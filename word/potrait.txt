This gorgeous family happens to be part of my family! Alex and I are cousins, and it’s such an honor to capture precious memories for his adorable family! In June, Cathryn and Alex traveled to Noblesville with their little girl, Leighton, who is almost 2 and a half years old. It was a hot, hot, hot summer afternoon, and they happily smiled and laughed and snuggled their way through the session with ease! To see some favorites from their maternity session, keep scrolling below! However, we must fast-forward to just a few short weeks ago, as they welcomed their second baby girl into their lives, Miss Ashten! She is beyond precious, giving them hours of sleep at a time, and melting everyone’s hearts with her little coo’s and calm demeanor. Ashten’s nursery was a dream to photograph, with lots of natural light pouring in, colorful and heartfelt details, and a cozy vibe that wraps you up in warmth. Her big sister Leighton is a natural – she adjusted her little sister’s bow, she showered her with tiny kisses, and stared at her new sibling with awe and wonder. It was absolutely a joy to see it all! Especially her delicate features and tiny toes! We took some photos in Leighton’s room too – she is so proud of her big girl room! This new family of four (plus two furry pups!) welcomed into their stylishly restored colonial home for their newborn session, and it was so fun to relive those first few days at home with not one, but too little ones! Alex and Cathryn, you two are wonderful parents, and I loved being there to document it for you! What a beautiful family you have! Thank you for sharing this special time with me! Can’t wait to see you again!!! Hugs!!!Happy Monday, friends! I hope you’ve been enjoying a wonderful summer! Here at our house, we’ve been spending as much time outdoors as possible! Remington has been catching frogs and learning more and more about them. One frog keeps coming back to hang out with him, and he’s named her Cutie. She’s an Eastern Gray Tree Frog. And we’ve found another kind of frog – a Northern Leopard Frog – who is a quick little leaper! Emerson loves watching every move that his big brother makes and just turned 19 months! Where does the time go?! Speaking of time, just over a year ago, our handsome nephew married his high school sweetheart, Adessa. Their outdoor wedding was set in a charming spot on the wooded property of Camp Rotary. The bridal party camped there the days leading up to the wedding to hang out and to decorate and to enjoy the summer and natural surroundings. And just after their 1st anniversary, I learned that their wedding was featured on Borrowed & Blue! Be sure to check out their post here!

Adessa and Logan, what a lovely wedding day you had! From your gorgeous tea length lace dress to your adorable First Look in the woods to the dance you shared as husband and wife…it was an honor to be a part of it all! Wishing you a wonderful anniversary and many, many more ahead! Love you both!!!Last summer I had the honor of meeting and photographing this sweet and lovely duo! I loved capturing their hugs and giggles and joy again this summer! We worked fast to beat the coming rain – and we wrapped up their session with a click of the camera and pouring raindrops! Luckily, the kind gentleman who owns the property we were photographing on — one of my absolute favorite places, Mill Top — allowed us to wait inside and then walked us to our cars with his umbrellas! It was really a fun and exciting evening! I couldn’t love working with this gorgeous mother and her darling daughter more. They share a happy, life-loving connection and are always up for an adventure! Thank you both so much for entrusting me to capture your beautiful mother-daughter bond! I’m sharing a few favorites below! Happy Summer!!!This year feels so different than any other. I suppose I could list the reasons why, mostly to serve as a reminder to myself when I need to get back to how I feel right now. You know those times, moments, and feelings you want to bottle up and keep forever? Yes, I’m talking about one of those special feelings. It’s like a delicate recipe of happiness, contentment, gratitude, joy, with a dash of resolve and resilience and grace. In a nutshell, that’s how I feel as I type these words. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have it all figured out. By “it” I mean life, and the balance of work and family, of being a mom and a wife, of feeling creative and needing to stay grounded. I don’t have these things figured out in the least. But in this moment, I am ok with that. And the sum of these things is what I want to bottle up and store up on a shelf for the times when I need it most.

I’m a mother of two darling boys. Today they have both made me laugh those deep, fulfilling laughs, be it with something Remington said or at the tantrum Emerson threw because he wanted his big brother’s sippy cup of water. Oh, and when Emerson had a Cheerio stuck to his forehead for quite a while at breakfast this morning and had no idea it was there! As Reggie said, that photo will be great first date material! Sometimes they can bring me to tears. In those sweet moments when they are quiet, snuggly, or when we lock eyes with each other while reading or playing. Especially if I hear certain songs that remind me of bittersweet times as they grow. Don’t get me started on the A Thousand Years song!

Sometimes I have to really let it soak in that I am lucky enough to a Mom to my two sweet babes. And there’s no way I could do it without my husband, Reggie. We make quite a team! And I owe a million thanks to my parents for all of their help and support over the years! Which leads me to the whole point of this post… Mom, thank you for sharing your unconditional love with me and my family, in all that you do for us, I could never begin to describe how blessed I am! Love you bunches! Thank you also for sharing these amazing peonies with us – passed down over generations from our family! What a special reminder these lovely blooms are! And blooming in perfect time for Mother’s Day! xoxo

To all Moms, Grandmas, and all who share their motherly love, from here and afar, in heaven and in our hearts…Happy Mother’s Day to you!It’s the First Day of Spring, and after a morning of clouds and rain, I can see the sun shining outside my window! I love it! It’s been an exciting few days around here because on Friday, my new and improved website went LIVE! Cue the confetti! Hooray!!! It feels so wonderful to have this project finally checked off of my to-do list! Many, many thanks to Ryan of Second Street Creative for all of his hard work, attention to detail, and patience with me throughout this entire process!

Some of my favorite parts of the new website is that it contains my portfolio and blog all in one place! Also, all posts have been sorted into fewer, easier to find categories, like Business, Engagement, Families + Kids, Maternity, Weddings, and more! Click around and leave a note in the comments with any thoughts or feedback! I’ve learned that this is going to be an ongoing work in progress, and I’m ok with that!

Another feature that I adore is the Praise page! I am so thankful for my sweet clients who have taken the time to share their hearts and put into words what their experience with me has been like for them! I have been moved to tears over and over by their comments, and I count my lucky stars to do what I love each day! Because these amazing people have shared my name with their friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers, I continue to meet and work with even more wonderful people!

I cannot wait to share more on this new home of mine on the internet! Thank you to all who have followed along, it has meant the world to me! Cheers to this pretty new space and what’s in store for Stewart Imagery! Happy Spring, indeed!A Post By: Darren Rowse

How do you take Portraits that have the ‘Wow’ factor?

Today and tomorrow I want to talk about taking Portraits that are a little out of the box. You see it’s all very well and good to have a portrait that follows all the rules – but it hit me as I was surfing on Flickr today that often the most striking portraits are those that break all the rules.

I want to look at some ways to break out of the mold and take striking portraits by breaking (or at least bending) the rules and adding a little randomness into your portrait photography. I’ll share ten of these tips today and a further ten tomorrow (update: you can see the 2nd part here).

1. Alter Your Perspective

Most portraits are taken with the camera at (or around) the eye level of the subject. While this is good common sense – completely changing the angle that you shoot from can give your portrait a real WOW factor.

Get up high and shoot down on your subject or get as close to the ground as you can and shoot up. Either way you’ll be seeing your subject from an angle that is bound to create interest.

2. Play with Eye Contact

It is amazing how much the direction of your subject’s eyes can impact an image. Most portraits have the subject looking down the lens – something that can create a real sense of connection between a subject and those viewing the image. But there are a couple of other things to try:

A. Looking off camera – have your subject focus their attention on something unseen and outside the field of view of your camera. This can create a feeling of candidness and also create a little intrigue and interest as the viewer of the shot wonders what they are looking at. This intrigue is particularly drawn about when the subject is showing some kind of emotion (ie ‘what’s making them laugh?’ or ‘what is making them look surprised?’). Just be aware that when you have a subject looking out of frame that you can also draw the eye of the viewer of the shot to the edge of the image also – taking them away from the point of interest in your shot – the subject.

B. Looking within the frame – alternatively you could have your subject looking at something (or someone) within the frame. A child looking at a ball, a woman looking at her new baby, a man looking hungrily at a big plate of pasta…. When you give your subject something to look at that is inside the frame you create a second point of interest and a relationship between it and your primary subject. It also helps create ‘story’ within the image.

3. Break the Rules of Composition

There are a lot of ‘rules’ out there when it comes to composition and I’ve always had a love hate relationship with them. My theory is that while they are useful to know and employ that they are also useful to know so you can purposely break them – as this can lead to eye catching results.

The Rule of Thirds is one that can be effective to break – placing your subject either dead centre can sometimes create a powerful image – or even creative placement with your subject right on the edge of a shot can sometimes create interesting images.

Another ‘rule’ that we often talk about in portrait photography is to give your subject room to look into. This can work really well – but again, sometimes rules are made to be broken.

4. Experiment with Lighting

Another element of randomness that you can introduce to your portraits is the way that you light them. There are almost unlimited possibilities when it comes to using light in portraits.

Side-lighting can create mood, backlighting and silhouetting your subject to hide their features can be powerful.

Using techniques like slow synch flash can create an impressive wow factor.

5. Move Your Subject Out of their Comfort Zone

I was chatting with a photographer recently who told me about a corporate portrait shoot that he had done with a business man at his home. They’d taken a lot of head and shoulder shots, shots at his desk, shots in front of framed degrees and other ‘corporate’ type images. They had all turned out fairly standard – but there was nothing that really stood out from the crowd.

The photographer and the subject agreed that there were plenty of useable shots but they wanted to create something ‘special’ and out of the box. The photographer suggested they try some ‘jumping’ shots. The subject was a little hesitant at first but stepped out into the uncomfortable zone and dressed in his suit and tie started jumping!

The shots were amazing, surprising and quite funny. The shoot culminated with the subject jumping in his pool for one last image!

While this might all sound a little ‘silly’ the shots ended up being featured in a magazine spread about the subject. It was the series of out of the box images that convinced the magazine he was someone that they’d want to feature.

6. Shoot Candidly

Sometimes posed shots can look somewhat…. posed. Some people don’t look good in a posed environment and so switching to a candid type approach can work.

Photograph your subject at work, with family or doing something that they love. This will put them more at ease and you can end up getting some special shots with them reacting naturally to the situation that they are in. You might even want to grab a longer zoom lens to take you out of their immediate zone and get really paparazzi with them.

I find that this can particularly work when photographing children.

7. Introduce a Prop

Add a prop of some kind into your shots and you create another point of interest that can enhance your shot.

Yes you might run the risk of taking too much focus away from your main subject but you could also really add a sense of story and place to the image that takes it in a new direction and gives the person you’re photographing an extra layer of depth that they wouldn’t have had without the prop.

8. Focus Upon One Body Part – Get Close Up

Get a lens with a long focal length attached to your camera – or get right in close so that you can just photograph a part of your subject. Photographing a person’s hands, eyes, mouth or even just their lower body… can leave a lot to the imagination of the viewer of an image.

Sometimes it’s what is left out of an image that says more than what is included.

Photo by Bukutgirl

9. Obscure Part of your Subject

A variation on the idea of zooming in on one part of the body is to obscure parts of your portrait subject’s face or body. You can do this with clothing, objects, their hands or just by framing part of them out of the image.

Doing this means that you leave a little to the imagination of the image’s viewer but also focus their attention on parts of your subject that you want them to be focused upon.

10. Take a Series of Shots

Switch your camera into ‘burst’ or ‘continuous shooting’ mode and fire off more than one shot at a time.

In doing this you create a series of images that could be presented together instead of just one static image.

This technique can work very well when you’re photographing children – or really any active subject that is changing their position or pose in quick succession.

Yesterday I shared 10 Ways to take Stunning Portrait Photography. We covered everything from altering your perspective as a photographer, to experimenting with lighting, to shooting candidly.

Today I want to continue on the same train of thought with 10 more tips for adding a little spice to your portraits.

11. Frame Your Subject

Framing is a technique where by you draw attention to one element of an image by framing it with another element of the image.

Image by darkmatter

Framing gives an image depth and draws the eye to a point of interest in the image.

You could do it by placing your subject in a window or doorway, have them look through a small gap or even use their hands around their face. See more examples of framing in photography here.

12. Go with a Wide Angle

Shooting with a wide angle lens attached to your camera can help create some memorable shots when you’re doing portrait photography.

At very wide focal lengths you can create some wonderful distortion. It might not be the type of shot you take of your wife or girlfriend (unless she’s in a playful mood) but using these focal lengths will enlarge parts of the face or body that are on the edge of the frame more than what is in the centre.

It can also give a wide open and dramatic impact when your subject is in an impressive setting.

13. Play With Backgrounds

The person in your portrait is the main point of interest – however sometimes when you place them into different contexts with different backgrounds you can dramatically alter the mood in a shot.

Sometimes you want your background to be as minimalistic as possible.

Portrait by akbar1947

While other times a dramatic or colorful background can help your subject really stand out.

The key is to experiment.

14. Change the Format Framing

Many photographers get stuck in a rut of only ever shooting either in ‘landscape’ (when the camera is held horizontally) or ‘portrait’ (when the camera is held vertically) modes. Look back through your images and see which one you use predominantly.

Just because a vertical framing is called ‘portrait’ mode doesn’t mean you always need to use it when shooting portraits. Mix your framing up in each shoot that you do and you’ll add variety to the type of shots you take.

15. Hold Your Camera on an Angle

Horizontal and Vertical framings are not the only options when it comes to shooting portraits. While getting your images straight can be important in when shooting in these formats holding your camera on a more diagonal angle can also inject a little fun into your images.

This type of framing can add a sense of fun and energy into your shots. Just don’t ‘slightly’ do it or you’ll have people asking themselves if you might have mistakenly held your camera crooked.

16. Take Unfocused Shots

As photographers we have ‘sharp focus’ drummed into us as an ultimate objective to achieve in our work – but sometimes lack of focus can create shots with real emotion, mood and interest.

There are two main strategies for taking unfocused images that work:

1. Focus upon one element of the image and leave your main subject blurred. To do this use a large aperture which will create a narrow depth of field and focus upon something in front of or behind your subject.

2. Leave the full image out of focus. To do this again choose a wide aperture but focus well in front or behind anything that is in your image (you’ll need to switch to manual focussing to achieve this).

These kinds of shots can be incredibly dreamy and mysterious.

17. Introduce Movement

Portraits can be so static – but what if you added some movement into them? This can be achieved in a few ways:

by making your subject move

by keeping your subject still but having an element in the scene around them move

by moving your camera (or it’s lens to achieve a zoom burst)

The key with the above three methods is to use a slow enough shutter speed to capture the movement.

The alternative is to have your subject obviously move fast but to use a shutter speed so fast that it ‘freezes’ their movement.

18. Experiment with Subject Expressions

In some portraits it is the expression on the face of your subject that makes the image.

Get your subject to experiment with different moods and emotions in your image. Play with extreme emotions

Portrait by carf

But also try more sombre or serious type shots

19. Fill the Frame

One way to ensure that your subject captures the attention of the viewer of your portrait is to fill the frame with their face.

It’s not something that you’d do in every shot that you take – but if your subject is the only feature in the shot – there’s really nowhere else to look.

20. Find an Interesting Subject

I have a friend who regularly goes out on the streets around Melbourne looking for interesting people to photograph.

When he finds someone that he finds interesting he approaches them, asks if they’d pose for him, he quickly finds a suitable background and then shoots off a handful of shots quickly (if they give him permission of course).

The result is that he has the most wonderful collection of photographs of people of all ages, ethnicities and backgrounds.

While many of us spend most of our time photographing our loved ones – perhaps it’d be an interesting exercise to shoot interesting strangers once in a while?

What Did I Miss?

So there you have it. 20 ways to add variety to your portraits (including yesterday’s 10 tips). But what have I missed that you’d add? I’m sure if we put our heads together we could come up with plenty of other techniques and ideas to add a little variety to our portrait photography. Looking forward to reading your suggestions in comments below.

In my last last post I wrote about the rule of thirds and placing your subject to one side of the image in an attempt to create balance.

The question that one reader sent me in response to this tip was:

‘When taking pictures of people which side is it best to put them on, the right or the left?’

I’ve got a long answer and a short answer.

The Short Answer: It doesn’t matter.

The Long Answer: Having said that it doesn’t matter let me make one qualification.

As a rule (and we all know that they are made to be broken) if the person (and it works with animals too) you are photographing is looking in one direction or even if their head is pointing in that direction it is best to place them on the opposite side of the frame.

You’ll see it best illustrated in the images on this page – in each case the person is not being photographed head on but have their head pointing either to the left or the right. As a result the photographer has given them some space on the side that they are pointing/looking.

The reason for this is that when a person views an image with a person looking in one direction or the other their eyes also are drawn in that direction. In a sense you’re giving the subject of your image some space to look into and in doing so create a natural way for the photos viewer to flow into the photo also.





Even just a slight turn of the head can be effectively framed using this technique.





Breaking the Rule



Of course breaking this rule produces interesting shots (in some cases more so). They might not be as aesthetically pleasing on some levels and could leave those viewing your images feeling a little on edge but this type of reaction to photos can be quite powerful also.

I met Photographer George Tippet at a function recently where he was the official photographer. I sidled up to him in a quiet moment, introduced myself and after chatting with him for a few minutes asked if he’d mind sharing a few ‘quick tips’ for portrait photography (his expertise) to share here on dPS.

George has a perspective that is a little different to other portrait photographers I know (in fact you’ll see he approaches it differently to me too) so I thought it might be interesting to share them and see what you think.

Here’s what he said (and what I managed to jot down quickly on a napkin).

1. Keep it Simple

The more complex your scene is the more unlikely you are to get a shot that is the X factor. Keep your backgrounds (and foregrounds) uncluttered, work with natural light where you can, if you have to use artificial light keep it simple and use as few lights as possible.

2. Set up the Shot before Introducing Your Subject to it

Be as prepared as possible before your subject arrives. If you’re shooting in a studio have your lighting ready and camera set up and ready to go. If you’re shooting on location know where you want to shoot. Have your camera’s settings ready to go and even do a few test shots before your subject arrives. This way you don’t keep them waiting around and get to photograph them when they are fresh.

3. Shoot into the Light

George was a big fan of back lighting – particularly when shooting outdoors. He talked about how this added interest, depth and sometimes color into an image. Lens hoods are a must if you’re doing this outside in bright environments though – you’ll also need fill flash.

Read more on Backlighting and Fill Flash.

4. Shoot from Slightly Below Your Subject’s Eyeline

One thing I noticed about George was that during the event he always seemed to be bending his knees slightly. He wasn’t that tall so I asked about it. He told me that he found that shooting from slightly (and only a tiny bit) below a person’s eye line was something that he found to be quite flattering for most people. He used this both with shots where a subject was standing or sitting. Similarly – George recommended lighting from slightly below rather than above a subject also.

Note: my personal preference has always been to shoot from slightly above the subjects eye line (although I think each situation lends itself to different approaches). What level do you typically shoot from?

These are George’s quick portrait tips and come from his own style. I know not everyone takes this approach though – what would you add?

Check out our new eBook – CLICK! How to Take Beautiful Photos of Your Kids

I thoroughly enjoy photographing children and have opportunity to do quite a bit of it lately after many of our friends have had babies.

Probably the most important tip I’ve learned in photographing them is to get on their level. So many of my friends show me photos of their kids which are taken from 4 or so feet above the child which does nothing but dwarf them and make them look almost toy-like.

Getting on your hands and knees or crouching down before you take a shot of a child takes you into their world and helps you to engage with them through the images you take.

Photographing Babies



Babies are particularly difficult to photograph because they are so immobile. I find that one of the best ways to get good shots of them is to put them on a baby rug and too literally lie down next to them with your camera right on the floor. In this way you’re looking directly into their big beautiful eyes and it puts the viewer of the photo in the unique perspective of an eye to eye place. If the child has the ability to lift it’s head the effects can be amazing as you almost find yourself looking UP into their eyes.



Photographing Older Children

The same principle of getting down low applies with older children although you do have a little less lying on the floor with them when they are at an age of walking.

I particularly find that with older children the best time to photograph them is when they are doing something that they enjoy. Go to the park with them and their parents, visit their house when they are painting pictures, get them to take you on a tour of their room or take them out to play their favorite sport.

While they are doing their activity hover around (at their level) and take plenty of shots. Also include shots with them and their parents and keep an eye open for those candid moments when they fall over, do funny expressions or ham it up for the camera.

If your camera has a continuous shooting mode it might also be worth keeping that on with bigger kids who tend to move around more. As I look back at the times I’ve done this it’s quite interesting to see that it’s often the second or third shot in a sequence that is best. Shooting just one frame at a time can mean you miss these golden opportunities.

Another benefit of continuous shooting is that you can end up with a great series of shots that might go nicely together to tell a story (see below).





Change your Focal Length



Another great way to change the angles of your shots when photographing kids is to use different focal lengths. If you’re using a DSLR it might be worth investing in a couple of different lenses (a wide angle one and a longer zoom) to give you different options. If you’re using a point and shoot (most of which have at least a 3x Optical Zoom) make sure you use it.

Taking pictures with a wide angle focal length can be particularly effective when getting in close to children. It opens up the angles and gives all kinds of interesting perspectives. I use a 17-40mm zoom lens on my DSLR which is brilliant for this. It still allows me to zoom in a little but at 17mm the impact is amazing.

A zoom lens allows you to take photos from further afield and will particularly be useful if the child is distracted by you taking photos. I use a 70-200mm zoom (the third image above was taken with it) which I find very useful.

Have Fun

Lastly, the key to good kid shots is to rediscover your own inner child. Kids love to have fun, they do the unexpected, they love to experiment and test things out and they love to play. Approach photographing them in this spirit and you’ll find your pictures take on a wonderful childlike quality.A Post By: Darren Rowse

When photographing people in their local context there are a number of techniques that I try to use (not all of them in every shot as some are mutually exclusive). Keep in mind the principles of treating people with respect mentioned in our last post:

Choose your Background – I’ve already talked about making shots contextual but one great way to do this is to think about what’s in the background behind the people you’re photographing. Ideally you want something that’s not too distracting but that adds to the context of the place you’re shooting in. Another technique for shooting shots of people that ignores the ‘contextual’ rule is to find a brightly lit position with a dark background. This can really help the face you’re shooting to pop out and capture the viewer’s attention. Fill your Frame – Some of the best shots I’ve taken of people while traveling have been where I’ve tightly frames people’s faces. This means either getting in nice and close to the person or having and using a good zoom lens. Go for natural (un-posed shots) – While sometimes the posed shots can work quite well they can also lack a certain authenticity. Photograph your subject doing something from their normal daily life. At work, in a marketplace, at home, feeding their child, crossing the street etc. Add another subject – Most of the shots I’ve taken of people over the years while traveling have been of single subjects alone in the shot. This is partly just my style (and is a good technique in and of itself ) but is something I’ve become quite aware of in the last few months. Adding a second person into an image takes a photo into a different place. No long is the shot just about a person and their environment but it somehow becomes relational. The viewer of the photo begins to wonder about the relationship and a new layer is added to your shot. Photograph a variety of people – Quite often it’s the shots of people dressed in national costume that tend to attract photographers when traveling. While these shots can be very effective I wonder if they are always really representative of a culture. Quite often these people have dressed up especially for a show or tourist attraction and the majority of people in that country look quite different. Mix up the types, gender and ages of people that you take photos of and you can end up with a very effective collage of faces of a country. Arrange an extended photo shoot – This goes against the nature of most travel photography which is usually very fast and spontaneous – but on one or two occasions when I’ve traveled I’ve had opportunity to sit with a person for a longer period of time and photograph them in a more extended manner. This enables your photographs to take a on a story telling nature and can lead to some wonderful sequences of shots using different photographic techniques, lenses and situations to shoot in. Get Candid – keep your camera to the eye for taking those spontaneous shots between the more posed ones. It’s amazing what images that you can find when the person isn’t ‘ready’ for you to shoot (or just after you’ve taken a shot). These shots often include people interacting with others or expressing true emotion. I find setting my camera to continuous shooting mode (where it will shoot burts of frames quickly) often leads to some wonderful candid shots. Lens Choice – I’m a big believer in that virtually any lens can take a good portrait shot if you work to it’s strengths. Having said that, some lenses do tend to lend themselves to great portraits. I find that a focal length between 50mm and 135mm is a good range to work with. Going for wide angle lenses can also produce interesting shots but you will often find that they do distort your subject’s face a little (sometimes this is very effective). Choosing a longer focal length can be useful for putting your subjects a little more at ease.

Most regular Digital Photography School readers are aware that a month ago I became a Dad. Our new son’s name is Xavier (you’ll get to know him over the course of this tutorial).

I’ve previously written about the topic of photographing babies and children from the perspective of someone who has had his services engaged to photograph other people’s babies – but the last month has presented me with a different opportunity – to becoming a digital camera wielding parent – a very different scenario.

Instead of being invited into a home for one hour to do a photo shoot I’m presented with a never ending variety of opportunities to photograph our baby.

Let me share 10 ‘lessons’ and ‘tips’ that I’m learning:

1. Documentary vs Portrait

While I had visions of taking lots of ‘cute’ shots of Xavier in his first week I found that what actually happened was that the first week of his life ended up being more like a documentary shoot. The focus of my shots ended up being of a lot of ‘firsts’. First moment with Mum, first bath, first time on the scales (he was just under 9 pounds), first outfit, first manicure (he had long nails from day one), first time meeting grandparents etc. I ended up taking a picture of him with every visitor that came (these will make nice gifts) and decided to leave the ‘cute’ shots until when we got back home and he’d settled a little more.

I did get a few more ‘portrait’ like shots in that first week but then ended up being more activity based ones, often with other family members. On returning home and over the three weeks since I’ve continued to take the documentary style shots but have seen a move to take a lot more portrait style shots also. Quite a few of our friends have commented on the nice balance between styles.



2. Finding the Angles

One of the biggest challenges in photographing babies that I know many of my friends struggle with is finding a good angle to shoot from.

In the days following birth it is especially difficult as babies tend to be kept swaddled in bunny rugs and all you end up seeing of them for 99% of the time is a little red head. Add to that the complication of the bumps, marks, scratches and misshaped heads that newborns also tend to arrive with and finding a flattering angle that will make more than just the proud parents ooh and aah can be difficult.

Don’t give up though, all is not lost – here are a number of things that you might want to try to help with the above problems:

Get Down Low – one key to many natural baby shots is to get down on their level. I’ve spent quite a bit of time over the last week or two lying on the floor next to Xavier. It’s something I think we both enjoy anyway but it’s also a great place to use your camera. Getting down low and getting in close (see below) does present some challenges in terms of focal length (I’m using a 24-105 zoom – usually at the widest focal length) but it means you end up with shots that feel like you’ve entered the babies world rather than you’re looking down on it from above.

Close Ups – another way to improve the angles and make your shots seem more intimate is to get in close by either physically moving in or by using a longer focal length. I’d suggest a longer focal length for the really close shots is better than getting too close as shoving a big lens in your baby’s face could freak them out a little.

I’d suggest a longer focal length for the really close shots is better than getting too close as shoving a big lens in your baby’s face could freak them out a little. Nursed Shots – some of the bests shots I’ve taken over the last month have been taken when people have been nursing Xavier. This puts him into a more upright position which makes him look a little more ‘human-like’ and opens up the angles for your photos. Try a number of positions (over the shoulder, sitting him up, laying him back in arms, lying him on his tummy etc) as each one opens up different possibilities. Also remember that your baby is not the only potential subject – parents, grandparents, siblings, friends etc all can add context to the shot and you’ll appreciate having more than just baby by themselves shots later!

3. Go Macro

We all love newborn babies because they are cute and small (if only they stayed that way). As a whole they are cute but they also are made up of many little cute body parts that present a photographer with an array of wonderful subject matter – especially if you zoom in on them.

If your camera has a macro mode or if you’re lucky enough to have a purpose built macro lens use it to isolate a single body part (like a hand, an ear, a foot, a mouth etc) and use that as the complete focus of your shot.

Doing this accentuates the detail that is often missed in the shots many of us take – and you’ll find they punctuate your full collection of photos beautifully and can even make great feature shots.

4. Identify ‘Happy Times’

Another challenge with newborns is that they don’t tend to spend a lot of time smiling. In fact they don’t spend a lot of time doing anything much. Sleeping, feeding, pooing, crying….. is there anything else?

Keep on the look out for those times in your baby’s life when he or she seems most settled and content. They may not smile yet but there are times in a daily routine which are better than others for photos. I find in Xavier’s day there are a couple of moments that are especially good. One is bath time (he loves it) and another is mid morning after he’s had half of a feed and when we let him have a little ‘play’ before finishing his feed off. These are times when we’re guaranteed to get wide open eyes and even a giggle or two.

5. Keep Your Camera Close

Our baby is pretty predictable in terms of his daily routine (we seem to have got him pretty settled into one already somehow) but there are moments all day long that he does something cute, disgusting, funny and worth capturing. Without the camera handy you’ll miss these moments as they are usually fleeting. We tend to leave our DSLR in our livingroom where we spend most of our time with him but also have a point and shoot in the bedroom for other shots.

6. Keep Shooting

Babies change every day, especially in the first few months, it’s exponential and quite amazing to watch. However unless you’re looking for the changes you can easily miss them so it’s it’s important to take shots regularly.

I have friends who took hundreds of shots in the first few days after their baby was born but who didn’t take any shots again until he was 6 weeks old. They realize just how much he’d changed and how much they’d failed to photograph him until they compared their early shots with the 6 week shots.

7. Befriend the Airbrush

A lot of shots that you see of babies in Flickr are quite amazing in how smooth and perfect they make them look. The reality is that many babies are not quite so ‘perfect’ (however much their parents think they are). Little scratches, sleep in the eyes, snotty noses, dried milk around the mouth, blotchy skin, birth marks and bumps etc are common for all babies.

You might like to keep a warm, wet face washer handy to wipe away some of these things but in some instances they will come out in your photos.

I don’t mind them most of the time – I think they show your baby as he or she is and there’s nothing wrong with that. However at times they can be a little distracting and for those special shots that you might like to give as gifts you might like to do a little photoshop retouching. Most post processing editing tools will have some sort of airbrush or retouching tool – learn to use it, even if it’s just to smooth over the main marks and you’ll be amazed by the results.

8. Take Out the Color

Another tip worth considering for a little photo editing is to tweak the color of your shot.

We’ve actually converted quite a few of our shots of Xavier into Black and White format. This has been useful for a number of reasons:

It’s great for dealing with the scratches, marks and blotchiness that I discussed above and significantly lessens the distractions that they bring.

It is great for ‘birth shots’ or those taken just after it. I’ve written about this before and we found that it really did work.

It softens your shots somewhat. Babies are soft, cuddly little things and taking the color out in this way accentuates this.

Similarly you might also like to experiment with de-saturating the colors in your shots to a lesser extent than going black and white. Leave a little color in your shots and you’ll end up with pastel like images that again soften the feeling of the shots and give it a very different look and feel.

9. Indirect Lighting

A challenge that I’ve faced is that it’s Winter here in Australia and that the lighting in our home is a little bleak. There have been a few brighter days than others when I’ve had some great results photographing him near windows in natural light – but in most cases I’ve needed to use a flash to some extent.

I’m no lighting expert but have found that my best results have been when I’ve used my flash in a ‘bounce flash’ way – shooting it up into a ceiling so that it’s indirect. This diffuses the light a lot which leaves Xavier less washed out in the shots, and more importantly means he’s not blinded by the light from it (we don’t want to blind our little ones by our photographic obsession – I actually asked a pediatrician about camera flashes and his advice was that it wouldn’t do damage but that for a babies comfort that indirect flash (ie bounced and/or diffused flash) would be advisable. I’m sure different doctors would advise different things but I play it safe with my bounce flash – and avoid flash altogether where possible). It also gives a fairly natural looking shot.

If you don’t have a bouncable flash try bumping up the ISO setting on your camera and increasing the aperture setting – this will mean you won’t need to use the flash at all if there is at least some natural light in the room. The other strategy would be to diffuse the flash a little by putting some tissue over the flash.

10. Pick Your Moments

There’s two things I want to say here:

Firstly timing your shots is important. Babies don’t move much but they subtly change their position and expressions in ways that can make or break a photo. I’ve had my camera set in continuous shooting mode since Xavier was born because I find that shooting a single frame often misses ‘the moment’. I’ve also ended up with some wonderful sequences of shots by shooting off three or four shots in a row.

Secondly I guess I wanted to remind us all that having a baby is not just a photographic opportunity and that it’s important to put the camera down every now and again. If you’re anything like me you could easily walk around with your camera permanently to your eye and forget to actually enjoy the moment.

“I’m heading to India next week and am looking forward to using my new DSLR. I’m particularly looking forward to photographing the people I come across but am a bit worried about whether I need to ask permission before photographing them in the street or other public places. Any suggestions?” – question submitted by DPS reader, Graham.

Thanks for the question Graham – you’re not the only person asking it. In fact I’ve written on this topic previously in my series on Travel Photography but I thought I’d go over my approach to asking permission to photograph people, especially in a foreign country.

Keep in mind that this is my own personal approach and that others do it much differently.

1. I always ask for permission if the person will be the main subject of my photo – I figure that I’m a guest in another country and that I want to behave like I’d expect someone to behave if they were in my home – with respect and friendliness.

2. If a person is a minor subject in a larger photo I don’t seek permission – it’s just not logistically possible to ask everyone on a street if you can photograph them!

3. Getting ‘permission’ can mean different things in different situations – often it’s simply a matter of holding up your camera and smiling with a raised eyebrow. Other times you might actually ask but gesturing will usually be sufficient enough to get a nod or a shake of the head. I find that it’s quite rare to get knocked back from a friendly approach.





4. If permission is not given or I’m sensing the other person is not comfortable with my actions I always stop and politely move on. I’ve found that in come cultures people say yes just to be polite but don’t really want you to take their shot. If I’m getting these vibes I stop immediately.

5. Before you travel do some research on what is and isn’t acceptable culturally – last time I traveled I was amazed to see how many people in the tour group I was with who had no clues about the culture they were visiting. As a result they often dressed and acted very inappropriately and annoyed a lot of locals by breaking social taboos. While this isn’t directly related to taking photos it does have an impact upon those you meet along the way that you might wish to photograph.

6. Smiling at the person and maintaining strong eye contact before, during and after taking your photo does wonders – for starters it helps with getting permission, then it helps them relax and lastly it shows your appreciation and that you value the person. Show a genuine interest in the other person, their life and what they’re doing and you’ll not only get a great shot but you’ll leave a positive feeling with the person – you might even learn a thing or two and make a new friend.

7. If I’m watching a performance or show where photography is allowed I don’t ask permission of individuals – I figure they’re doing it for some sort of payment and are used to it.

8. If photographing children I take extra care to get permission from a parent where there is one present. I think photographers need to be particularly careful in this area.

9. I don’t pay or tip people for photographs – I know many photographers do this but it’s something I’m not comfortable with. I do travel with little gifts from home (toys, pens, badges etc) which I like to give to people I meet along the way but don’t use these as ‘payments’ or bribes as such.

10. Don’t travel in a large group – One of the keys that I’ve found to getting good street photos of people is to travel in small groups or (when it’s safe to do so) alone. There’s something about a large group, all carrying cameras, coming up to a person that is very overwhelming. If I am traveling with a larger group I tend to hang back on the edges of the group and look for my own opportunities.

As I’ve written before – “Keep in mind what you’d feel like if a stranger walked up to you in your neighborhood and asked for a photograph and act in a way that you’d want to be treated in that kind of situation.”

On the birth of our first child we were given by a friend a gift certificate for a photographic family portrait. The deal included one photo shoot in a studio and some prints.

While I had taken thousands of shots of our baby I thought it’d be fun to go in for our photo shoot – after all it was free and I’m always interested to see how other photographers work.

There is a lot that I could say about the shoot and the photographer (I’ll refrain from getting too picky) but one of the main things I came away reflecting upon is how much more I prefer location oriented (or environmental) portrait photography than studio based photography.

While I know a good photographer can work wonders in a studio (I’m not so sure the photographer we had fit in the ‘good’ photographer category) shooting in a location where the subject is comfortable and has some familiarity with has a lot going for it.

What is an Environmental Portrait?

An environmental portrait is a portrait taken of a person or people in a situation that they live in and a place that says something about who they are. It is often a place of work, rest or play.

Before I get into some ‘how to’ tips for taking environmental portraits let me chat a little about ‘why’ I like them.





Why do I prefer environmental portraits?

they give context to the subject you’re photographing

they give points of interest to shots (something you need to watch as you don’t want to distract from your subject too much)

they help your subject relax

they often give the viewer of your shots real insight into the personality and lifestyle of your subject

These shots sit somewhere between the purposely posed shots of a studio portrait (they are posed and they are unmistakably ‘portraits’) and candid shots which capture people almost incidentally as they go through their daily life.

So lets turn our attention to some ‘how to’ tips on environmental portraits.





How to Take Environmental Portraits – the Tips:

Spend time getting to know your subject

Before you select a location and start shooting, spend some time getting to know your subject. Find out where they spend their time, what the rhythm of their life is like and observing their personality. Out of this you’ll not only find appropriate locations but will begin to get a feel for the style of shots that might be appropriate and you’ll begin the process of helping your subject relax into the photo shoot. If possible it might even be helpful to accompany your subject to some possible locations to see both how they look but also how your subject behaves and interacts there.

Choosing a Location

Sometimes a location chooses you (it’s easy) but on other occasions you need to be quite deliberate and purposeful in making your choice (and it can take a lot of searching). When choosing your environment you ideally want to get one that:

says something about your subject – after all that’s what this style of photography is all about

– after all that’s what this style of photography is all about adds interest to the shot – as I’ve written in previous tutorials – every element in an image can add or detract from your shots. The environment that you place your subject in needs to provide context and be interest without overwhelming the shot

– as I’ve written in previous tutorials – every element in an image can add or detract from your shots. The environment that you place your subject in needs to provide context and be interest without overwhelming the shot doesn’t dominate the shot – sometimes the location can dominate the image so much that it distracts your viewer away from your main focal point (the subject). Try to avoid cluttered backgrounds (and foregrounds), colors that are too bright etc. Keep in mind that you might be able to decrease the distractions with clever use of cropping, depth of field and subject placement.

Props?

Props can make or break an environmental portrait. If they are subtle and naturally fit within the context of the environment they can be very appropriate and add to the image nicely but you’ll want to avoid anything that doesn’t quite fit or that potentially distracts the attention of viewers.

The same goes for the clothes that your subject wears. Try to be true to the context without getting too outlandish.

Posing

What sets the environmental portrait apart from candid portraits is that you post your subject (it’s a fine line and you might end up doing a bit of both in any given shoot). Don’t be afraid to direct your subject to sit, stand or act in a certain way that fits with the environment that you’re shooting in. Some of the poses might seem slightly unnatural and dramatic but it’s often these more purposely posed shots that are more dramatic and give a sense of style to your shot.

The expression on the face of your subject is also very important in environmental photography and you should consider how it fits with the overall scene. For example if you’re shooting in a formal environment it may not be appropriate to have your subject with a big cheesy smile and you might like a more somber or serious look. Again – mix it up to see what does and doesn’t work.

Camera Settings

There is no right or wrong way to set your camera up for an environmental portrait as it will depend completely upon the effect you’re after and the situation you’re shooting in. You might find that shooting at a smaller aperture (larger numbers) will be appropriate as it will help keep the foreground and background in focus. I generally shoot with a wider focal length in these situations also to give the environment prominence in the shot. Of course this doesn’t mean you can’t shoot more tightly cropped or with a large aperture and shallow depth of field – ultimately anything goes and you’ll probably want to mix up your shots a little.

When it comes to famous images the Mona Lisa by Leonardo Da Vinci is one of the most recognized in the world.

When I visited the Lourve in Paris a couple of years ago I was stunned by the crowds of people gathering around this small image, pushing and shoving to get close and to take a picture of it (I got some great shots of the crowd).

The Mona Lisa has been at the center of much debate and speculation over the years but why is it an image that intrigues people so much and what can we learn from it as photographers today?

While we live in a different time (the Mona Lisa was painted in the 1500’s) and use different technology – is there something in this famous image that we can be inspired by as image makers today?

Lessons from the Mona Lisa for Photographers

Today I want to explore some of the different aspect of the Mona Lisa and point out some things that Leonardo did in painting this image that I think we could take away as portrait photographers today.

Composition

While we look at the Mona Lisa today and see it’s composition as fairly standard and simple – for it’s time the composition of the Mona Lisa was ground breaking and has set new trends in painting which have been followed for centuries since.

One of the compositional elements that the portrait is known for is Leonardo’s use of a pyramidal composition which shows the subject with a wider base at her arms and her hands forming the front corner and everything is in place to draw the eye up her body to her eyes and her infamous smile.

Take Home Lessons for Today

The same form of composition can work for us. While I wouldn’t dare suggest that this is the only or best way to set up a portrait shot – the pyramidal composition is one worth trying.

The Pose

Again – today we look at Mona Lisa’s pose and it seems fairly normal but for it’s day it was quite revolutionary as most portraits at the time were rigid, stiff and quite often profiles rather than front on.

In contrast Mona Lisa is somewhat relaxed and at ease as she leans upon the arm of a chair with her hands crossed in a relaxed fashion.

While she’s slightly turned to one side she sits open to the viewer and holding their eye.

Also unusual for the time was the fact that Leonardo went against the norm with the framing of this image and opted for a three quarter length pose rather than a full length one. In this way he filled the frame with his subject which lends itself to an intimate image and little room for distraction by her context.

One last aspect of the pose is that the Leonardo has positioned Mona Lisa’s eyes at the eye level of the one viewing the image. This brings a sense of intimacy to the image as we the viewer gaze directly into her eyes (there’s not a sense that we’re looking down on her or that she’s doing that to us).

Take Home Lessons for Today

This classic pose works today. Fill your frame with your subject by using a three quarter length pose, relax your subject, have them turn their body slightly away from the camera and look directly at the camera. Give their hands something to lean on (they can look awkward otherwise). Most of all – attempt to relax your subject.

The Background



Much has been written about the background of the Mona Lisa and we can draw out a few things from it for today.

One thing worth noting is that while paintings of the day generally had both the subject and background in sharp focus with lots of detail – the background of the Mona Lisa seems to ‘fade’ or become more blurred and out of focus the further from the subject it extends.

This was unusual for the time and is an effect that many portrait photographers use today by choosing a large Aperture to make for a blurred background that leaves the viewer of the image to focus upon the subject.

While there is definitely points of interest in the background (there’s a lot of debate about whether the two sides of it ‘match’ and whether it’s supposed to be some kind of a fantasy/imaginary background) the colors in it are somewhat bland, muted and subtle – again leaving the focus upon Mona Lisa.

Take Home Lessons for Today

There are different ways to use a background of a portrait. It can either be used to put your subject into context by showing their surrounds – or it can be used as a backdrop that is largely a blank canvas with few features so that your subject stands out.

In a sense Leonardo has done both with his background. It doesn’t take the focus away from the subject – yet the landscape behind her does have an element of mystery and interest to it. It’s also visually complementary to the subject with some of the shapes and colors almost mirroring colors and shapes in the subject’s clothing.

The lesson is to carefully consider your backgrounds – they can greatly enhance or detract from your portraits.

Light

One of the things that I like about the Mona Lisa is the way in which light falls upon the subject. Leonardo uses light to draw the eye of the viewer to the parts of the image that he wishes to be highlighted (the face and hands) and balances the image nicely by placing hands and face in positions that counter one another.

Leonardo also uses shadow (or a lack of light) to add depth and dimension to different aspects of the image – particularly the area around Mona Lisa’s neck and in the ripples on the dress on her arm.

Take Home Lessons for Today

Think about how your subject is lit. Use it to draw the eye to key parts of your image but also use shadow to create depth and dimension to your shots.

Clothing

We’ve talked about clothes and portraits here at DPS before and Leonardo takes the approach of darker less obtrusive clothes in this image. Once again – this is a little different to other portraits of the time which are renowned for being bright.

While her dress has quite a bit of detail (the lace work is quite fine and the detail in the folds on her arms are lovely) and it all is within keeping of the feel of the image – everything works to highlighting her face.

There’s also a lack of any kind of jewelry or any other kind of accessory to distract the viewer away from Mona Lisa’s face.

Leonardo obviously wants something about the woman herself to shine through in this image rather than anything else.

Take Home Lessons for Today

Clothes are another element that can be a real distraction in a portrait. Take a lesson from Leonardo and use clothes that fit with the subject and give them context – but which don’t distract your viewer.

Framing

One of the things that I’d not noticed about the Mona Lisa before that i read about today is that on either side of the subject just under and to the side of each of her shoulders there is half of a round ball shape (see the images below on the left).

It is believed that what we see of currently of the image is actually slightly smaller than the original. Part of the image was lost when the image was re-framed at some point. What were the balls?

The most widely accepted theory is that in the original and full version of the painting two columns extend up from the balls on either side of Mona Lisa. She’s actually sitting on a balcony overlooking the view behind her. You can see the horizontal edge of the balcony extending between the two columns.

Here’s how one artist reproduced the Mona Lisa with the extra columns.

Whether or not the columns in the original looked exactly like this reproduction or not I’m not sure – but it seems that Leonardo used a technique that we call ‘framing‘ in photography today. This technique is all about drawing the eye of the viewer of an image to your main subject. It also has the potential to add a little context to a portrait (with the columns it would be more obvious that Mona Lisa is sitting on a balcony).

Take Home Lessons for Today

Learn to use techniques like framing to draw the eye of the viewer of your images to your main subject. Frames can be subtle and a natural part of the environment around your subject. Don’t use them in every shot but do keep your eye out for opportunities to include them to add another dimension to your portrait work.

Mystery

Who is the woman (its been argued that she is anyone from a female form of Leonardo himself through to the wife of the man who commissioned the image)? What is the background? Why is she smiling (or is she)?

There’s something mysterious both about the subject herself (her look is both alluring and aloof) and the way that the image was painted (Leonardo used a technique called ‘blurring’ around the edges of the subject that was new for his time that give it a mysterious quality). This leaves the viewer of the image asking questions and entering into it with imagination. Leaving elements of the image open to interpretation can make an image impact it’s viewer.

Take Home Lessons for Today

One of the elements that takes a proficient image and makes it a great image is that it goes beyond being a record keeping exercise and becomes a story telling one.

The Mona Lisa has drawn viewers to use their imagination and have conversation about it for centuries simply because it leaves parts of the story untold. This is something that can’t really be learned as a photographer – but is something that comes with experience.

What Lessons Does the Mona Lisa Teach You about Photography?

I once took some body language classes in a previous job to help me learn both how to read people and how to present myself. One of the tips that stuck with me from it was that when you lean towards a person that you’re interacting with you present yourself as interested and engaging. Similarly – if someone else is leaning towards you they are probably listening to you and are engaging with what you’re saying.

A similar thing can be conveyed in portrait photography.

When taking an upper body portrait a simple way to make your subject more engaging and friendly is to have them lean in towards your camera a little.

You don’t need them to lean in or bend over too far – but even having them do it just a small bit can help. Another way to give the impression of your subject leaning in is to photograph them from slightly above (as in the image on this post).

Alternatively if you are wanting a more formal portrait you’ll probably want to post your subject in a more upright position with them sitting up straight.

Lastly, if you’re feeling like experimenting with leaning your subject back away from the camera it’s possible to create a feeling of joviality as if they are leaning back for a belly laugh. Of course leaning back can also make your subject look quite uncomfortable and even defensive and it’s a pose that I tend to avoid.

The following post on depth of field was written by Hawaii photographer Natalie Norton, of natalienortonphoto.com.

We talk a lot around here at Digital Photography School about Depth of Field. I’m writing this based on the assumption that we all understand that in layman terms, “depth of field” is the portion of an image that is in sharp focus. To illustrate: in landscape photography, generally you’re working to achieve a very large depth of field. You want EVERYTHING in the scene to be in sharp focus. With portraits, photographers are often shooting for (lame pun intended) a more shallow depth of field, focusing in on their subjects and working towards fall off or blur in the background. Why do you think this is the case? Clearly to draw focus to the story being told. Well what if you want to tell a different story OR what if you want to tell the same story in a different way? Today let’s talk about depth of field and some ways you can use foreground in a different way to draw a different kind of attention to the story you’re trying to tell. Here are 3 ways to create “story telling images” using foreground to achieve creative depth of field.

1. Framing with foreground:

I wanted to find the most straight forward illustration I could to get the point across clearly. This shot (left) is from a recent senior portrait session. I wanted to draw attention to the senior, particularly I wanted him to seem strong and capable: READY to take on the world.

The frame of the foliage around him draws attention right to him… it focuses the story of the image. I recognize that foreground used in this way can also be distracting, this image is borderline distracting, I recognize that. You need to be aware of that and be sure to make foreground work for you, not against you.

How to get a shot like this: well I was shooting with a 50mm lens. I got right up close to the foliage that separated Melvin and I. First I tried with auto focus, but because of my proximity to the leaves, I had to switch over and focus manually.









2. Don’t be afraid to throw your subject out of focus:

When you’re doing portraiture, you’re generally trying to establish some kind of mood through imagery: happy, solemn, lovesick, sexy. . . Generally the mood is created through posing etc. For the next shots I let the foreground tell a few different kinds of love stories for me.

Back in March, I was shooting on Balboa Island in California. We were out on this dock shooting the typical, fun, happy, “we can’t wait to get married” stuff and I was getting bored. I had them take their shoes off and put their feet in the water. Better, but still pretty typical. So I waded out into the water, hitched my skirt up around my waist, nearly dropped my camera into the ocean, and created these. First I focused on the couple and threw the water out of focus. It’s a nice shot. It looks like they’re sitting on the dock watching the sun set. Nice. Then I focused on the water throwing my subject out of focus. A little sexier huh? Like, we’re sneaking up on some steamy make-out sesh. . . ha ha! But really, both images are good, while neither image is going up for any awards any time soon, they’re both good images. The second just speaks to you a little differently, tells their sexy love story a little more clearly.

Here’s another image where I decided NOT to focus on my subject, again to tell his story better. Back to Melvin’s senior session. Here he is walking into his future. I wanted to show where he was going, but also to illustrate that he’s on his way there because of where he’s been. . . I think this image is a powerful one that illustrates hope for the future and grounding in the past.

Don’t be afraid to throw your subject out of focus!

3. Same shot+different focus=different story:

This next series is a favorite of mine. Essentially the same shot, but different focus makes it tell a different tale. Both images were taken within seconds of each other. But they each tell a different person’s love story. First, the love of a father for his daughter and the second the love of a little girl for her daddy. Framed side by side. . . ahh. I get all warm and cozy just thinking about it.

Depth of field is a simple concept, but the ways it can be arranged to create powerful images are endless. Go get fresh with depth of field! Feel free to report back! We’d love to hear/see how you did!

Happy Shooting!

When taking head shot and upper body portraits of people one simple posing tip that I’ve picked up over the years is to angle the shoulders of your subject rather than to have them even or squared in your shot.

While the shoulders might not seem like an important aspect of a portrait they can actually set the tone for an image as they’re the widest part of your subject and they are visually what the main point of focus for your image (the head) is sitting upon.

Generally speaking, angling the shoulders slightly gives you shot balance and helps lead your viewer’s eye into the shot towards your main focal point. It also stops your subject seeming out of proportion as it lessons the width of the shoulders slightly.

Getting this effect might mean actually getting your subject to lean in one direction or another or it could simply mean getting them to turn their body a little so you’re not photographing them directly front on. Another technique can be to frame your subject slightly off center so that one shoulder is actually out of the frame.

Some believe that in positioning your subjects shoulders make the one closest to camera the lower of the two – but I’ve found that you can get an interesting effect by doing it the other way around too.

Of course – this isn’t a hard and fast rule and sometimes the completely front on symmetrical shot can leave a shot can have a very powerful (and often confronting) impact upon your readers also. So as always – experiment with posing your subject in a variety of ways and see what works best for you and your subject.

Here are a few shots that illustrate some of the different ways to angle shoulders to avoid the front on look.

Learn a few tips from red carpet celebrities on how to get your subjects looking their best when photographing them.

Waistlines

Here’s a quick posing tip if your subject is a little conscious of their waistline and want it to appear a little narrower than it really is (I’d put that at about 90% of us).

Get them to rotate their upper body slightly at the waist and you’ll find that it gives the impression of a thinner tummy area. It’s amazing what a simple twist can do! This is a popular technique with many red carpet celebs.

Thighs

Another popular red carpet pose involves celebrities crossing one leg over in front of the other one. This has the effect of narrowing the thigh region a little (and/or making the celebrity look like they need a bathroom break).

Bustlines

Lastly, if you want to emphasize the bustline of your subject, get them to arch their shoulders back a little. This action naturally pushes the chest out a touch.

Of course combining these three techniques in the one shot can also leave your subject looking quite silly and needing a trip to the chiropractor! Use them with moderation or you’ll end up with a very unnatural looking pose.

When posing a portrait subject, two important questions to ask yourself include:

1. ‘where are they looking?’

2. ‘what impact does this have on the shot?’

Where your subject is looking can have a real impact upon your image and how those looking at your image view it.

In many instances your subjects eyes determines where the viewer of your image looks.

Here are a few examples:

two people looking at each other – draws your viewer into ‘relationship’

a child holding out a plate with a chocolate cake but looking at the camera gives a feeling of invitation – the child becomes the focus

a child holding out a plate of chocolate cake and looking at the cake can give a sense of ‘desire’ – the cake become the focus

Looking outside the frame can leave the viewer wondering what they’re looking at?

There’s no right or wrong but each option can have consequences (good and bad) on the shot.

Here are a couple of considerations to keep in mind when making a decision on how to pose your subject:

Looking Away from the Camera

If your subject is looking at something other than the camera viewers will naturally want to see what it is. You then have two choices – either to show them or not hide the object of their gaze.

If the object is within the frame this will often create a focal point for your shots (example – in the picture of the ‘bubble boy’ above).

If the subject looks outside the frame it can create either tension or intrigue. This can either spoil or make the shot!

Looking Directly At the Camera

If your subject is looking directly at the camera it’s hard not to look at them – they become the focal point

Sometimes when a subject looks directly at the camera it can create discomfort or tension for the viewer of the image – it can be a very strong and confronting pose. This is not necessarily bad – in fact it can really make the shot quite powerful – but it is something to be aware of.

The direction that your subject looks when being photographed can have a profound impact upon an image so give it careful consideration. Many different poses can work and will alter the mood and focal point of the image considerably.

The key is to know what you’re wanting to achieve and to experiment with different set ups to get those results.A Post By: Darren Rowse

Sometimes the smallest things in a photo can impact the overall feel of the image.

I learned this important lesson the first time I photographed a wedding.

The grooms hands gave it all away.

On the day itself I thought the bride and groom were very relaxed an enjoying the day, but on getting the photos back I was immediately drawn to the hands of the groom. In virtually every shot they were clenched or grasping at the sleeves of his suit coat.

In showing the photos to others I found that quite a few of them noticed the same thing while others thought he looked stressed but couldn’t quite put their finger (no pun intended) on why.

I later found out that the groom was having second thoughts about what he was doing all day long. His hands told the story.

The hands and fingers are often giveaways to how the rest of the body is feeling.

How to Photograph Hands

1. When posing a subject pay particular attention to their hands and encourage your model to keep them relaxed and their fingers separated.

2. If your subject can’t seem to relax their hands – consider composing shots that don’t include the hands (head shots and upper body shots).

3. Sometimes the best thing to do with hands is to give them something to hold or do. Consider using a prop (as long as it adds to and is relevant the shot and isn’t distracting) or have them rest upon some other element in the shot (a leg, a chair etc).

4. Lastly – hands tend to look best when shot from the side. Front on shots of hands can often look quite blob like.

I recently went on a buying frenzy of photography books over at Amazon.

One of the books that I purchased was The Perfect Portrait Guide: How to Photograph People by Michael Busselle and David Wilson.

Portrait photography has always been the main focus of my own photography and so I was keen to read this book (recommended by a reader of this site).

I’ve spent the last few days reviewing the book and have really enjoyed doing so.

I should say up front – this is not just a digital photography book. Most of the techniques in the book are applicable to digital photographers and film photographers alike but it is not specifically targeted at digital photography.

While there are a lot of photography books out there with a very technical approach – The Perfect Portrait Guide is much more practical in it’s approach and uses A LOT of case studies as the basis for it’s teaching on portrait photography – this in my mind makes it a very useful book.

The structure of the book is fairly simple – there are four sections:

Informal Portraits Formal Portraits Lighting Cameras and Equipment

Sections 1 to 3 are largely case studies. Each page covers a different aspect of the section’s topic and has at least one photograph taken by a Pro Photographer. The photograph is then talked about in the sections of:

Seeing : the story behind the image

: the story behind the image Thinking : the challenge of the photographer – what they wanted to do

: the challenge of the photographer – what they wanted to do Acting : how the photo was taken

: how the photo was taken Technical Details : the gear used

: the gear used Rule of Thumb: (not on every page) – a technique or rule that photographers can learn from the case study.

Section 4 tackles the topics of Choosing a Camera, Choosing Lenses, Camera Accessories, Lighting Equipment, Apertures and Shutter Speeds, Understanding Exposure, Choosing Film and Finishing and Presentation. Once again – this is not specifically focussed upon digital photography.

My Opinion

This book is not focussed upon teaching advanced techniques but gives a good overview of many of the topics a beginner to intermediate portrait photographer will want to learn in their craft.

The fact that it’s not focussed upon digital photography is at times frustrating (why a book published in 2002 has such a focus upon film photography I do not know) – however most of the techniques mentioned are just as relevant (for example composition techniques go across both mediums).

I really enjoy learning by seeing what others have done and so found the format of this book to be worthwhile. The example images are great and give inspiration for trying new things.

If you’re looking for a technical book then this is probably not the book for you

What Should I Wear in my portrait?

This is a question I get asked a lot by clients – so I thought it might be something that was worth some exploration in a tutorial.

The clothes a person wears in a portrait can have a big impact upon the end result of your image. When talking to a subject about what to wear I generally ask them to bring a few different outfits so that we can have a little variety to work with.

A few things to keep in mind:

1. The Comfort of your Subject is Important – Sometimes…

One of the challenges of photographing someone that you might not know very well is helping them to relax. I find that the clothes that they wear and the environment that you’re photographing them can have a big impact upon how relaxed they are and how natural they look. If they are happy with how they look then you’ll have a good chance of capturing them looking themselves.

Having said that – sometimes the best shots are of people when they are slightly ‘on edge’ or out of their comfort zone.

I can’t really explain it – but I’ve had some real luck in choosing outfits for people that they might not necessarily have chosen for themselves.

Sometimes throwing a curve ball at your subject in this way can take them slightly out of their comfort zone and dressing in something that is different to what they usually wear will get you a ‘wow’ shot.

For example – I recently photographed a young entrepreneur who told me that he was most comfortable in fairly casual clothes. I told him to bring a few options and as I suspected he turned up with two pairs of jeans and two hoodies.

I predicted this might be the case so had brought one of my own suit jackets and a white shirt from home and after photographing him in his outfits asked him if he’d mind me taking a few shots in the shirt and suit jacket.

At first he was skeptical but something happened when he put on my outfit – he became someone else and presented to the camera in a more confident manner. He later told me that he was also amazed how the change of clothes made him feel a little more special.

It was the shots in my outfit that he ended up using.

2. Clothes Can Put People into Context

As much as we all like to talk about not judging a book by it’s cover and getting to know the ‘real person’ before summing them up – a person’s outward appearance says a lot about who they are and what we think of them.

The clothes that a subject wears in a shot will convey meaning and tell those viewing the image something about the person. So think carefully about what you’re trying to achieve with the image and let this be communicated through the clothes that you suggest your subject wears.

ie – if you’re after a fun vibe in your shot let them get a little casual and crazy with their clothes. If you’re wanting to portray them in a more formal way dress them that way.

3. Dark and Plain Clothes

While I generally let my subject choose a few outfits for themselves I almost always ask them to include a darker top in their options.

There’s something about a simple, dark top that allows the real focus of an image to be the persons face. An added bonus of dark clothes is that they tend to be slimming also (so your butt might not look big after-all).

As I looked back over my portfolio recently realized that the majority of portraits that I’d selected to show off my work were of people in fairly plain and unobtrusive clothes. No crazy patterns, lines, dots or bright colors – just understated basics that allowed the person to shine.

One exception to the black/dark top rule is that it can depend upon the complexion of the person. A very fair complexion with a very dark top can be too much of a contrast and when shooting someone with dark skin tones dark clothing can mean not enough contrast.

Another exception to this rule can be with kids whose portraits can come alive when you introduce some nice bright colors. The key however is to watch out for when the bright colors include zany patterns.

The last exception is when I’m photographing groups – everyone in black can look a little somber – but groups are a whole other topic.

4. Collars

Another quick tip which I base upon my portfolio – collared shirts can be an effective thing to have your subjects wear.

I’ve not put a lot of thought into why they work – but particularly when photographing men, I find that a collared shirt has a way of framing the face that can be quite flattering.

I wouldn’t say collars are essential for every shot (I’ve taken plenty of good shots of guys in non collared shirts and T-Shirts) – however there’s something about them that just ‘works’ – at least in my mind.

5. Long Sleeves and Pants

Lastly – I also like to avoid short sleeved tops or shorts.

When arms and legs are exposed and there’s lots of skin visible I find that it can be a distraction from the main focal point of the photo – the face. That one is just a personal preference though and I’m not even sure why it is that I like to do it that way.

What do You Think?

That’s my approach – what is your view on what clothes you prefer your subjects to wear?

Is it more important to you for your subject to be comfortable or is your style to put them in an outfit that will add something special to the shot.

Should I use my camera’s Portrait mode when shooting Portraits or would I be better off manually setting my camera up?

Unless you have a high end DSLR, most digital cameras these days come with an array of shooting modes (including portrait mode) for a photographer to choose from when out using their camera. These shooting modes are designed to help camera owners to quickly tell their camera what type of shot they are taking to give the camera a hint at what type of effect you want.

The results that your digital camera will give you in these modes is often quite good – however they do take the chance to be a little creative with your photography away and if you’re someone wanting to improve your photography you’re less likely to learn how to use your camera effectively by sticking to them.

So how do you set up your camera to get great Portrait shots without having to use Portrait Mode?

As with almost all questions that we explore here at Digital Photography School – this one will have a variety of answers depending upon your photographic style, the camera that you’re using and the type of portraits that you’re hoping to achieve – however let me share a few starting points that will hopefully give you some good results so that you can then start experimenting (note: it might be helpful to have read my previous post on Exposure if you’re a beginner – hopefully this will help you get some of the concepts I’m explaining below a little quicker).

Switch to Aperture Priority Mode

When I’m photographing portraits I generally switch my camera away from any of the Auto modes into Aperture Priority Mode. This enables the photographer to choose the aperture that they want to shoot at while still allowing the camera to make decisions about shutter speed (to ensure well exposed images). If you’re a more experienced photographer you might want to try out full manual mode – but Aperture Priority mode will probably do for most of us.

Choose a Large Aperture for Nice Blurry Backgrounds

The actual aperture setting that you choose when in Aperture Priority Mode will vary from situation to situation and between camera/lens setups – but in most cases you’ll probably want to start with a fairly large aperture as this will decrease the depth of field in your shots (this is what portrait mode generally does). This will help to ensure you have a nice blurry background. The beauty of this type of setting is that it leaves your subject as the only element in focus – highlighting them as the main focal point and removing any other distracting elements (read more on using aperture to get blurry background).

Keep in mind that if you have a very fast lens that choosing the maximum aperture available can decrease the depth of field to a point where some parts of the face of your subject are in focus while others are not. Also the very maximum aperture might mean you are not shooting in your lenses sweet spot. Pull it back a stop or two and you might get a slightly sharper image – the key is to do some experimenting if you have the time to do so.





Select a Low ISO for Smooth Shots

The ISO setting that you use will vary depending upon the lighting situation that you’re faced with – but in most cases you’ll want to decrease the amount of grain or noise in your shot by selecting a low ISO (I try to stick to the 100-200 range). The main thing to watch when selecting an ISO setting is what impact it has on your shutter speed. Sometimes choosing a very low ISO will mean your shutter speed is just too slow for sharp images (I’ll talk about this below). If the shutter speed is too slow at the ISO you’ve selected you’ll either need a larger Aperture or a higher ISO.

Shutter Speed

If you’re shooting in Aperture Priority mode as we’re suggesting above, the shutter speed will be selected by the camera automatically once you’ve selected the aperture and ISO settings that you want. However – if you choose to shoot in full manual mode you’ll need to pay attention to shutter speed. Because your subject is a moving one (even if they are trying to stay still) you’ll probably want to keep your shutter speed at least to 1/60 second or faster (1/125 is probably better, especially if you’re not using a tripod).

White Balance

The white balance that you will need to select when taking portraits will again vary upon the lighting conditions that you’re shooting in. Learn more about White Balance.

Focussing Mode

Many digital cameras allow the photographer to choose between a number of focusing modes. At one end of the spectrum the ‘Auto Focussing’ setting on most cameras will use multiple focussing points to determine where to focus. At the other end of things is a manual focussing mode where the photographer has complete control. In the middle is often the option to focus the camera on a single point in the frame.

While the multi point AF setting will generally get things pretty right in most normal shooting conditions, in some situations it is helpful to be able to use either manual focusing or the single focussing point options (particularly in lower light). I personally prefer the single point setting as it allows me to pinpoint the exact part of the face that I want in focus (almost always the eyes).

Metering Modes

In a similar way, many cameras allow a number of different metering modes. Once again, on many cameras this ranges from a multi point system where the whole frame is taken into consideration when working out exposure levels through to a single point metering system (spot metering) where the photographer can pin point one small part of the image that they want the exposure to be base upon. Again, I often choose a spot metering mode when shooting portraits – particularly when the subject is backlit or where there are bright or dark parts of the image that could skew the results.A Post By: Natalie Norton

Over the years my camera has become an extension of my arm, relate? Of course you do. Those lucky souls like you and I who discover they have a passion for photography quickly find it to be magically intoxicating in every way. We just can’t get enough.

Well passion and creative vision out the wazoo (pardon my French), even when coupled with perfect light, perfect equipment, and all the experience in the world will amount to very little if you’ve got a subject who just will not cooperate.

When I first started as a professional photographer it was mind baffling to me the way some people responded when I’d point my camera at them. “FOR PETE’S SAKE!” I’d lament to my husband after a shoot. “They were paying me to photograph them, they hired me, it wasn’t as if I ripped them from their houses, tied them to a tree and forced them to say ‘Cheese.’ What am I missing here?!?” Grrr. I would leave shoots like those EXHAUSTED… absolutely ready for a cup of tea and a bubble bath, and TOTALLY dreading uploading the photos… knowing that all I’d ended up with were a bunch of awkward smiles on tight, strained faces.

Then there came a time in my career when I was in desperate need of a head shot… I hate being in front of the camera… I know. I know. Go figure. Does the irony of all this tickle you as much as it does me? I called a friend and fellow photographer to handle the shoot. “OK Nic, short and sweet. We just need ONE good shot.” She pulled that camera out and it was everything I could do not to run screaming down the beach. She may as well have actually ripped me from my house and tied me to a tree. My heart was pounding, my palms were sweating and I could feel all the blood in my body racing to my face. Needless to say we DID NOT get that “ONE good shot.” Alas, the finished product showed just nervous, awkward bubble headed me … with a face as red as a cherry I might add.

Well over the years I’ve finally cracked the code to dealing with people photographically… Thus, The Human Side of Photography. Here’s 4 tips on how I work toward those beautiful, natural, genuine portraits that make our hearts sing, end up framed on our walls, and/or sell like crazy post production.





1. Handle the Hands:

Give your subject something to hold. If their hands are busy it’s generally enough of a cognitive distraction to curb their camera anxiety.

Take this bride for example. She was really struggling being herself in front of my camera during her bridal shoot. So, I handed her her fiance’s guitar and voilÃƒÂ . Beautifully natural in every way! I love this shot.

2. Pull up a Chair:

I carry a stool with me to every shoot… ALWAYS. It has saved me a million times over. When people sit, they will 9 times out of 10 loose the nervous rigidity they have when they’re standing. The situation automatically steps away from the formal air of photographer/photographee and instantly feels more casual.

This momma-to-be insisted incessantly that she was just “not photogenic” (if only I got a nickel for every time someone spit that at me … or maybe a dime for every time I proved them wrong… hmm). Thank Heaven for my trusty stool. Momma loosened right up once seated, and we got something genuine and sweet.

3. The Attraction of Distraction:

Distract your subject. Get them talking about something you know they’re interested in, ask them questions about their family, pets or favorite super heroes if you get desperate. Do whatever you can to pull their attention away from themselves. I find that shifting their attention to me by making fun of myself to be a trick that’s tried and true.

I’ve also been known to suddenly start barking like a dog to inspire spontaneous laughter… quacking like a duck is also a good bet… trust me, once you get a couple of good laughs out of your subject… it’s all a breeze from there. Laughter releases endorphins and thus a general sense of well-being, at least that’s what “they” say… hey, it works for me!

An example of this was an engagement shoot I did a while back. The groom-to-be was completely relaxed and comfortable, but the bride was just NOT quite getting there. To make a bad thing worse, we started out shooting in a marshy field where we were literally swarmed by mosquitoes… I counted 26 on my legs at one point (like actual bugs biting me simultaneously… not just 26 bites … but I digress). She was bitten TERRIBLY and was SO uncomfortable. I could sense her discouragement, so as we walked to the next site (as far away from said swamp field as possible) I told her fiance to give me a couple of seconds of shooting and then just to start tickling her like crazy.

It was so much fun for everyone! We got a fun shot of the tickle-fest, though that wasn’t the end in mind… the goal was to help her feel relaxed and comfortable for the rest of the shoot- and guess what? It worked like a charm. (This tip is especially good when working with children. Get them talking about something they love and it’s like flipping on a light switch to those sweet genuine expressions that only children can give).

4. A Tip from Aretha… R.E.S.P.E.C.T:

Remember that your subjects deserve your respect… whether it’s your own kiddos or you’re on hire. If you’ve got a subject or two or more who are just plain uncomfortable, seek out privacy for the shoot as much as possible. If you’ve got something in your head that you’re working towards and your subject just isn’t diggin’ it… drop it and move on to something else.

Ultimately you want nice pictures AND a nice memory of the shoot as a whole. If your subject feels understood and respected, that’s your first step in breaking them out of that awkward little box and truly capturing their essence. I learned this the hard way… my oldest son (4yrs old) used to head for the hills when he saw me coming camera in hand.

Once I learned to just respect that, and simply leave him alone at times like these… he actually started coming to ME and asking me to shoot him. And here’s the treasured result:

In this shot he said to me, “ok Mom, now I’m going to pretend like I’m sleeping.” Ah, be still my beating heart!

Happy shooting!

Catchlights – What are they and why are they important in Portrait Photography?

A “catchlight’ is simply the highlight of a light source reflected off the surface of the eye. This highlight adds depth and dimension to the eye, and gives the eyes life in a portrait or snapshot.

Catchlights come in all shapes and sizes, depending on the shape and size of the light source, and its distance from the subject. For example, a large, round umbrella reflector will produce a larger, more pronounced catchlight than a small portable electronic flash. Many portrait photographers use a reflector placed in the lap of the subject, or in a similar position. This usually produces a larger catchlight in the lower half of the eye (often not flattering).

In portraiture, where more than one light is used, the eyes may end up showing two or more catchlights. It’s the photographer’s job to decide which ones to save and which should be removed, using photographic software such as Photoshop.

Positioning Catchlights

The position of a catch light is determined by the placement of the “key” and “fill” lights, and changes as their height and angle away from the camera lens change. A studio portrait will show the final product with a single catchlight in each eye, typically in the 10 or 2 o’clock position, created by the main (“key”) light.

The real reason for the conventional placement of catchlights at 10 or 2 o’clock is unknown, but the earliest portrait painters found that the most pleasing balance resulted when either of those positions was used.

Consider that early artists didn’t have the luxury of multiple lights in a studio, using instead the Sun or light from a large open window. The result was a single catchlight and because the Sun illuminated the subject from a high angle, the catchlight reflected from a higher spot on the eye.

Experiment with Catchlights

I encourage you to become a student of catch lights, particularly if you have a keen interest in portrait work. Experiment with removing, then adding, catchlights to the eyes in your portraits. Use different sizes and positions, and notice the effect.

Before photographic software was developed, unwanted catchlights had to be removed by “spotting,” a labor-intensive process involving a fine camel-hair brush and an assortment of dyes. Adding a catchlight was possible, but even more difficult.

Use every opportunity to study the position and shape of catchlights in other photographers’ work, and in the eyes of your friends and coworkers. Study the paintings of old master portrait artists to learn how they used light. Your portrait work will benefit from this effort.

There is no hard-and-fast rule regarding catchlights; it’s simply a matter of personal taste and preference. You will see all manner of catch light size and placement in journals and in professional portraits. There is no “better’ or ‘worse” way to place them.

Candid styles of photography are increasingly becoming popular both in general day to day photography but also in formal photographic situations. Last time I was asked to photograph a wedding the couple actually hired me purely to take paparazzi style shows of them and their guests throughout the day. They had another photographer for the formal shots and gave me the brief of getting a behind the scenes look of the day.

The results, when they put together my shots with the formal ones were a wonderful blend of photos that told a fuller story than if they’d gone for one or the other.

Below are a number of tips to help photographers improve their ‘candid’ photography. Please note that these tips are not about taking sneaky, voyeuristic or true paparazzi shots (ie photographing people without their permission) but rather about how to add a more candid feel to the shots you take of people that you know.

1. Take your Camera Everywhere

Probably the best way to take spontaneous photographs is to always be ready to do so. I have a DSLR which I take out when I’m on a shoot but between shoots like to cary with a quality point and shoot camera that I can whip out at a moments notice to capture the many opportunities for a good photo that life presents us with. Taking your camera with you everywhere also helps people to be more at ease with you taking their photo. I find that my friends and family just expect me to have my camera out so when I do fire it up it’s not a signal to them to pose but it’s a normal part of our interaction – this means that they are relaxed and the photos are natural.

2. Use a Long Zoom

Obviously the further you are away from your subject the less likely they will be to know that you’re photographing them and the more natural and relaxed they’ll act. Using a telephoto lens or long zoom enables you to shoot from outside their personal space but keep the feeling of intimacy in the shot you’re taking.

3. Kill the Flash

Perhaps the most obvious way that you can signal to another person that you’re photographing them is to use a flash. There’s nothing like a blinding flash of light in the eyes to kill a moment. If possible (and it’s not always) attempt to photograph without the flash if you’re aiming for candid shots. When in lower light situations increase your ISO setting, use a faster lens, open up your aperture or if your camera has a ‘natural light mode’ turn it on. Hopefully one or a combination of these approaches will help you blend into the background a little more.

4. Shoot lots

I’ve written about this before on this site but when you shoot multiple images quickly of a person you can sometimes get some surprising and spontaneous shots that you’d have never gotten if you shot just one. Switch your camera to continuous shooting mode and shoot in bursts of images and in doing so you’ll increase your chances of that perfect shot.

5. Position Yourself strategically

While Candid Photography is about capturing the spontaneity of a moment and getting that perfect shot at the right split second of time I find that if you think ahead and anticipate what is about to unfold in front of you that you can greatly increase the chances of getting some great shots. So at a wedding get to the church early (or even go to the rehearsal) and think about what will happen during the ceremony and where will be best for you to stand to capture each moment. Which way will people be facing? What will they be doing? What will the light be like? Thinking through these issues will save you having to run around repositioning yourself when you should be shooting images – it’ll also mean you take a whole heap less shots of the back of people’s heads!

6. Photograph People Doing things

Images of people doing things tend to be much more interesting than people sitting passively doing nothing. For one your subject will be focussed upon something which adds energy to a photo (and takes their focus off you) but it also puts them in context and adds an element of story to your image. Timing is everything in Candid shots so wait until they are distracted from you and fully focussed upon what they are doing or who they are with and you’ll inject a feeling into your shots of them being unaware and that the viewer of your image is looking on unseen.

7. Photograph People with People

Something very interesting happens when you photograph more than one person in an image at a time – it introduces relationship into the shot. Even if the two (or more) people are not really interacting in the shot it can add depth and a sense of story into the viewing of the image. Of course ideally in candid shots you’d like some interaction between your subjects as that will add emotion into the shot also as we the viewer observe how the people are acting.

8. Shoot from the Hip

If your subject is aware that you’re there and that you have your camera out they might tense up or act a little unnaturally as they see you raising your camera to the eye. The beauty of digital cameras is that it doesn’t cost you anything to take lots of shots and it can be well worth shooting without raising your camera. To do this most effectively you might want to set your lens to a wider angle setting to make up for any aiming problems you might have.

9. Mix up your Perspective

The other beauty of shooting from the hip is that it gives you a slightly different perspective to take the shot from (ie shooting from 3 feet height instead of 6). This adds to the candid nature of the shots. In fact sometimes it’s the slightly crooked, slightly out of focus or poorly composed shots taken from this type of angle that ends up looking the best because they come across as quite random. Of course you can add all these new perspectives to your shots without shooting from the hip. Crouch down, get up high, frame your shots on an angle, zoom in close and then quickly zoom out to a wide angle, break the rules of composition etc and you will add a new perspective to your shots that can mean they look fresh and surprising.

10. Frame Images with Foreground Elements

A trick that I often use in candid shots is to purposely include something in the foreground of the shot to make it look as though I’m hiding behind it. You might do this with by shooting over someone’s shoulder, by including a little of a tree branch or the frame of a doorway.

11. Take Posed Shots into Candid Territory

One of my favorite times to shoot candid shots is when other people are taking formal ones. This is because everyone in the shot is focused on the one element (the other photographer) – but it’s not you. If the main photographer has posed the happy couple of the day or their bridal partly look for a different angle to them to take a shot of the same subject. Often if you take a few steps to the side and shoot from almost a profile position you can get great shots. Also zooming in to take shots of just one or two of the people in a larger group at these times can work well. Also try zooming right out to take a shot of the photographer and their subject all in one. If you’re the only photographer and you’re taking formal shots a great technique is to take your posed shot and then continue to shoot after everyone thinks you’ve finished. It’s often the shots just after the posed one that are the best as people relax and look at each other.When it starts pouring outside, most photographers may run for cover and hide from the rain. For photographer Ilko Allexandroff, heavy rain becomes an opportunity to shoot stunning backlit portraits of subjects. Here’s a 20-minute video in which Allexandroff discusses his methods, helpful tips, and 6 types of lighting setups he uses.



Here are the 6 scenarios and some beautiful example photos for each one:

#1. Backlight for Silhouettes

A single light will illuminate raindrops and turn your subject into a silhouette.

#2. Backlight Plus Reflected Light

If you’d like your subject’s face illuminated with a single light from behind, you can place your subject next to a wall or other structure that can bounce some light back onto them.

#3. Backlight Plus a Light Source

Placing your subject near another light source such as a store window can illuminate their features while the single flash in the back illuminates the rain.

#4. Backlight and RAW Editing

Allexandroff sometimes uses a single flash behind the subject and then increases exposure on the subject’s face and features during post-processing.

#5. Front Light and Back Light

You can use a flash behind your subject to illuminate the rain while using another strobe in front of them to expose their face and body.

#6. Cross Lighting

Moving the back-side flash to a diagonal position can produce a different look.

Here are some other example photos by Allexandroff for inspiration:

“Black dogs are just as loving and just as playful but shelter staff can have a hard time photographing them,” says Fishman. “A good photograph is crucial to creating interest for a potential adopter.

“While I can’t take great photos of every black dog in a shelter I can bring awareness to the problem and with this series show that black dogs are

stunningly beautiful.”

Fishman recruited 14 black rescue dogs for a photo shoot and provided the portraits to their rescue. A single Instagram photo of one of the groups of puppies led to all of them being quickly adopted.

Here’s a video with some video portraits Fishman shot at the same time:

You can find more of Fishman’s work on her website, Facebook, and Instagram. Back in 2015, we shared a different project in which Fishman shot portraits of animal shelter cats wearing hats.

(via Shaina Fishman via Fstoppers)In this article, I am going to highlight 5 key things that I see portrait photographers doing that I consider to be “in need of improvement.” And although there are no hard-and-fast rules to photography, try to think of it as being similar to an instrument being slightly out of tune or a meal that’s perhaps a little too salty. These are glaringly obvious errors to the well-informed but may not be so obvious to those who are just starting out.



I’ll also just say that photography is a subjective field and just like any other art form there is going to be people who agree and disagree with what I classify as “mistakes.” History lecturers, for example, will teach us that the Berlin wall fell in 1989, mathematicians will tell us that 2 + 2 = 4. These are what we refer to as facts, but in our world of the arts we aren’t quite so strictly governed and it isn’t quite as simple.

There will certainly be occasions to bend these “rules” for artistic reasons, but if you want to attach commercial merit to what I’ll be discussing here than it’s worth pointing out that I was responsible for training all of the new portrait photographers in a large studio for many years. It’s factors like the ones I’ll outline below that when addressed in the newer photographers, saw significant increases in photographer clients’ average spend per shoot.

So take from this article what you will, but if you avoid these issues in your client work, and your clients aren’t photographers themselves, it’s practically guaranteed to improve your sales.

1. Catchlights

The first one is nice and simple to avoid once you know what you’re looking for and thankfully it’s super easy to know when you’ve done it or not. It is, of course, catchlights in the subject’s eyes. Catchlights are the spectral highlights in eyes created by the direct reflection of the key-light. Having these highlights present means that you’re giving the eyes shape and without them, eyes can often look dead and lifeless.

In fact, to further cement my point, I’ve seen filmmakers simply digitally remove catchlights to signify the death of a character on screen. Catchlights are certainly powerful signifiers of life so correctly positioning the key light just above the models head and slightly in front will ensure the face is lit properly and that the eyes are receiving light to give them that tell-tale sparkle.

2. Under-Lighting

Under-lighting is simply lighting that is coming from below the subject in relation to the camera. Think of those 1960 horror movies that needed to make monsters and creatures scarier, they’d simply light them from below. The reason this looks so bad is that we’re used to seeing one another when we’re lit from above. We go outside and the sun is lighting us from above, when we’re indoors the lights are lighting us from above.

In fact, this is so present in our visual recognition of the world that lighting faces from anywhere apart from above simply tells our brains that something is wrong. So although this should be painfully obvious to us and very few of us would make the mistake of lighting a subject solely from below, I still see the same effect happening when photographers decide to introduce fill lights.

The under-lighting effect happens when the fill-light is actually casting more light on the subject’s face than the key-light. I see this done all the time and often by apparent professionals. In fact, not too long ago a corporate head of one of the worlds leading camera manufacturers released a head-shot with horrendous under-lighting so it’s not just enthusiasts that fall foul to this one.

Thankfully it’s easy to fix, simply turn down your fill-light. Yup, that’s it, simply turn the power down. In fact, take some test shots at varying powers of fill-light if you’re not sure and then choose the favored image and corresponding power to be extra safe. It’s very easy to see which you prefer when images are side-by-side in this way so it’s definitely worth doing.

Pro Tip: If you’re photographing a series of people like a group of corporate head shots, for example, pay attention to each individual you photograph. If you’re photographing a 6′ 5″ inch man and then a 5′ 3″ inch lady afterward adjust and move your key and fill lights accordingly. Failing to do so will mean that the young lady is going to be a lot closer to the fill-light than the key-light. And guess what?! You’ll have created under-lighting by simply not changing a single thing.

3. Subject to Background Separation

This one could be argued as a little more based on preference and I’ve seen it done well for effect in both instances, but as a rule, though if you’re starting out with lighting try to avoid it. This lighting technique is about showing shape and form with shadow or the absence of light. If you’re photographing a subject with only a single light for example and they’re positioned too far away from the background then that background will drop off into pure darkness just like the shadow side of your subject does.

What happens now is that visually, the background and the shadow side of your subject is indiscernible from one another resulting in the viewer’s eye not being able to tell where the subject ends and the background begins. More often than not this leads to the subject appearing far larger in the shot than they might like. This is one of those lighting techniques where you’re not necessarily doing anything wrong but you could definitely be doing something better.

If you only have a single light then move your subject and setup closer to the background and allow your light to spill over onto the surroundings so that it now appears lit in the shot behind the model. This is a very simple technique and obvious once it’s been pointed out but incredibly effective at dramatically changing how a shot and your subject can look especially if you only have a single light to work with.

4. Joined-Up Shadows

Again this is a mistake that is quite subtle and sometimes tricky to avoid but it’s always worth being aware of it. A basic rule of lighting for me is that you always want to create ‘clean lighting’. Clean lighting is lighting that doesn’t scream “hey look at me, I’m using 6 lights in this setup”, it’s lighting that compliments the subject and nothing more.

Remember adding that fill-light earlier? It added a lot to the image without screaming that you’re using an extra light, that’s clean lighting.

If you’re looking for an example of the cleanest lighting around then it can often be found in the hands of car photographers. Good car photography is arguably one of the hardest disciplines in our field to master. If they position a light in the wrong place when lighting a car then the ultra-shiny surface of the car will lose its clean lines and shape instantly. Car photographers never use more lights than they have to but each one is positioned with absolute precision. In fact, I’ve even seen some car photographers place lights to solely generate hub-cap catch-lights in the shot but not actually light the surface of the car in any way. They are a patient breed indeed!

For those of us that are photographing people, we often don’t have the time or the need to be that precise but it’s still certainly worth knowing what looks good and why. One way to do this is to join-up your shadows.

Thankfully joining up the shadows is easier to do than you might think, you simply just have to watch out for it. In this example image here I’m using one light to illustrate my point but every light you add to a scene should undergo the same scrutiny. The one thing that we as portrait photographers have to contend with over car photographers is that our subject is often moving but we can use it to our advantage if we’re clever.

In this example image, I am specifically looking at the shadow created by the nose. You should see that in one shot the shadow ends and then some light cuts across the cheek and then another shadow is created by the cheekbone itself. This is what I would refer to as messy lighting, it’s creating more distracting elements to a shot than necessary. I then asked the model to move her head to her right so that we now have no gap of light between the nose shadow and the cheekbone shadow. This essentially gives the impression of a single shadow area on the face and this is what I refer to as “clean lighting”.

Of course, I could just as easily of asked her to move her head to the left and removed the nose shadow altogether. This again would be cleaner lighting than before.

It might not seem like much but imagine this happening with fill-lights, hair lights and background lights in the mix, the lighting would start to look very messy and untidy, very quickly.

Watch out for these additional shadows and where possible adjust your lights to avoid them or better yet get your subject to move and pose to avoid them as well.

5. Poor Hair-Light Placement

The placement of hair lights is another example of how something looks fine until you’re shown how it could look better. Firstly you have to know why you’re using hair lights, to begin with. Are you simply adding them to add a little shine to the hair? Are you trying to accentuate shape in the hair or are you just trying to create a strong separation between your subject and background? All of these are valid reasons and with a little care and attention, your hair light placement can achieve all of these.

For a lot of my portrait work, unless it’s a specific hair shoot where I would have multiple hair lights my general aim is to show clear separation from model to background. Imagine you have a dark background and a subject with very dark hair, you’ll quickly see that the two will begin to merge into one another so placing some hair lights can be a simple solution to avoid this.

So now that we know why we want to use the hair lights, what’s the best way of using them? First off is the placement of the lights and this is crucial as it won’t be in the same place for every subject you photograph. As a guide, the lights should be placed behind the subject pointing forward towards the edges of the subjects head.

Next, they should be placed just far enough apart so that no light falls onto the front of the face and the tips of the nose and lips. This may sound incredibly obvious but keep an eye out for how many shots you see where the hair lights are catching the front of the face and causing this incredibly confusing and distracting lighting on the subject’s features. You have to ask yourself, “which shot looks better, the shot with or without multiple highlights falling on the subjects face?” It should be plain to see when it’s pointed out but you’d be surprised how often you see professional portraits like this.

The other key factor is the power of the hair lights and as a rule, I tend to stick to as little amount of light as I can get away with. Remember, flash photography is never about “look at how many lights I’m using” but about adding lights to compliment the subject, most of the time these additional lights in the setup will require less power than you think.

In Conclusion

So there you have it, just a handful of the classic lighting mistakes that I personally think can easily be avoided by those setting up portrait lighting. Like I mentioned at the start, these are subjective and there are always occasions to bend these ‘rules’ with lighting but if you’re starting out or just have this nagging feeling that your lighting needs improving, you may find that these 5 classic pointers will help.

I also attributed commercial value to these tips at the start of the article. I rarely do that because photography is predominantly an art form and art has very few rules. But seeing as these 5 rules were a significant part of the lighting-bible that I provided to new photographers who entered our busy studio, I felt I should mention it.

Everybody takes photographs for different reasons but professional photographers rarely take photographs for other photographers and as such, they need to keep the client’s perception of ‘great’ photography in mind. Sure if you want to impress your friends on Instagram then don’t worry about the catchlights and nose shadows because you can write it off as ‘artistic’. If on the other hand, you’re shooting for a client, you better make sure your lighting is locked down tight because although your client may not be able to explain why the lack of catchlights in the model’s eyes looks lifeless, they won’t be using your skills again.

Know your audience and shoot accordingly. As a general guide, my lighting philosophy is to keep the lighting as clean as possible and keeping questions in mind like, ‘does adding an additional light to this setup add an interesting element? Or ‘does that extra light highlight a distracting one? Keep that in mind when you’re setting up each and every light you’ll be fine.

Now new sample photos have emerged to show what this smartphone flash system can actually do.



Godox published a blog post announcing an event this weekend to officially launch the A1. Here’s what we know about the A1 so far: it’s an off-camera flash and trigger for smartphones that contains a flash, LED lights, and a 2.4GHz radio trigger for synchronizing your phone’s camera to Godox’s radio-enabled flashguns and studio heads.

Here’s what the product looks like along with a use case involving an iPhone shooting with an A1 and a Godox flash:

We’ll likely learn about exact specs, pricing, and availability in the next week or two. Stay tuned.My name is Elliott Verdier, and I’m a French photographer who recently returned home from Kyrgyzstan. I spent four months making a portrait of the country with a 4×5 analog large format camera.





Four months in Kyrgyzstan, portraying this unknown country with a large format camera, through faces and landscapes. This work highlights the generational disparities between those nostalgic of an abolished USSR order and modern westernized youths born after the fall.

It covers the trials of a young, woebegone country struggling to simultaneously form a national identity and keep pace with a global economy. Relics of a past era mingle with the faces of a population frozen in transition.

About the author: Elliott Verdier is a documentary photographer based in Paris, France. You can find more of his work on his website, Facebook, and Instagram.Austrian photographer Markus Hofstaetter recently captured this fiery wedding portrait, titled “Love on Fire.” It’s a single exposure that can be shot with a much smaller budget than you might think. And no, you don’t need a gigantic flaming explosion.



Hofstaetter started by building a small pond in his yard just so his portrait would have a reflection on the ground.

He set up two flashes on the scene to illuminate the couple during a long exposure.

For the flame, Hofstaetter went out and purchased an odor-free lamp oil, a pot, a steel bar, carabiners, chains, and linen towels (for putting out the fire). By hanging a Kevlar wick from the pole, soaking it in oil, and then lighting it ablaze, Hofstaetter created a column of fire behind the couple that an assistant could hold.

Walking the column of fire back and forth behind the couple during a long exposure photo creates a giant wall of fire in the resulting shot.

Finally, firing the flashes during the long exposure illuminates the couple in the foreground and completes the shot. Voila!

That’s how this wedding portrait was captured using a 3-meter-tall flame, two flashes, and a single 4.4-second exposure.

Here’s a behind-the-scenes video showing the shoot in progress:

You can find more of Hofstaetter’s work on his website, blog, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.Photographer Rob Snow and Red Bull have just released a new red hot series of photos that involved gasoline, baseballs, a blowtorch, and World Series hero Kris Bryant.



Third base is sometimes referred to as the “Hot Corner” because balls get sizzled that way at speeds up to 125mph. Snow says that the idea was to replicate an image taken in a game, with one minor difference: the baseball would be on fire.

Snow spent months planning the shot, which he says was the biggest in terms of production value that he’s ever worked on.

“The biggest challenge was that we wanted to also do a behind the scenes video, to prove to fans that the fire wasn’t just dropped in via Photoshop,” he says. “We wanted to prove to everyone that this was a real sporting moment, using a real ball on fire. This meant that the lighting had to work for both stills and video, and of course the amount of bodies on set increased exponentially.”

Here’s the behind-the-scenes video:

“In addition, we only had two hours with Kris, and as the ambient light was only going to be right for about 15-20 minutes (for the Hot Corner portion of the shoot), we were really up against the clock the whole shoot. So, we had to make it happen as efficiently as possible, and not waste any time while Kris was on set.”

It’s not every day you get to shoot a million-dollar athlete having fireballs lobbed at them, and Snow says it was rather nerve-wracking. Not everything went entirely to plan.

“We shot this in a fairly small town and essentially rented all of the available lighting in the town,” Snow continues. “During the pre-light day, I discovered that I was a full five stops underexposed from the settings I had requested from the lighting technician. We had to make use of last minute additions to our lighting package, and some creative settings in camera, to make it work.”

“I think it’s a combination of the enormity of the project, the expectation level to deliver, working with pyro and mitigating risk for Kris, and also the fact that there was a crew shooting an extensive behind-the-scenes video. The video crew was there on the light-test day and I felt out of my element being in front of the camera, and it didn’t help my nerves when things weren’t going as planned on the pre-light.”

The hard work paid off. Here are some more of the final images from the shoot:

Red Bull tells us that Cubs fans need not worry — Bryant wore flameproof Adidas Nomex underpants and a long sleeve shirt that actively pushed heat and sweat away from the body. But his Rawlings glove was toasted pretty good!

Eliminate these from your post-processing workflow to take your photos to the next level.



Here’s a quick rundown of what Batista highlights in the video:

Mistake #1: Over Saturating Color: All the color boosting, all the time, everywhere.

Mistake #2: Over Sharpening: Blurry shots cannot become sharp, so don’t try.

Mistake #3: Haloing: Filters gone crazy, sloppy masking, and other sadness.

Mistake #4: Red fingers, hands, feet, and ears: These pesky humans!

Mistake #5: Glowing Eyes: Don’t make your subject into a campy extraterrestrial.

Mistake #6: Fake Camera Blur (Bokeh): Difficult to do correctly, usually not worth it.

Mistake #7: Black or White Vignettes: A tiny bit of one, and none of the other.

Mistake #8: Not Zooming in to check details: No really, this is a common mistake.

Mistake #9: Blurred Skin: The infamous amateur retouching mistake.

Watch the video above for a full explanation of what these mistakes are and how to avoid them.

(via Nino Batista via Fstoppers)Instead of editing your images in post to inject color into your shadows, you can use gels to do it in-camera. Here’s a 6-minute video from photographer Jay P. Morgan at The Slanted Lens demonstrating 4 different methods.



1. Foam Core Mount

The first method uses a white piece of foam core as a fill card with the gel taped on to it. This will act as a colored fill light, and bounces the color of the gel into the shadows.

2. Mirror Mount

By using a mirror in place of the foam core you can create a harder colored light on the side of the face for a more intense look.

3. Gel Used Directly on Strobe

This is a more common way of using gels. You can position the strobe to use it as either a rim light or a hair light and apply the gel directly to the strobe.

4. Gel Inside Softbox

This will have a broader effect across the entire image, not just on one side. Place the gel inside the soft box and then position it either above or below the camera, using it as a fill light. Morgan notes that you should dial back the light enough so that the color doesn’t create issues with the natural skin tones.This 12-minute tutorial from photographer Joel Grimes demonstrates two methods for creating dramatic portraits using a minimal amount of gear. Both techniques use a beauty dish; the first with a single light source and the second with the addition of 2 edge lights.



Grimes shoots these portraits at 24mm, which accentuates his subject’s upper-body bulk and creates more drama. For his first setup, Grimes uses the beauty dish to concentrate the light on his model and part of the black background behind him, allowing it to taper off to black.

Once Grimes has nailed the exposure with his settings at ISO 100, f/7.1 and 1/200, he adjusts the height and power output of his strobe rather than changing his camera settings. Raising the light creates a little more drama in the shadows, though going too high creates an unattractive rake across the face.

For the second portrait, Grimes goes for a more edgy look, dressing his model in an all-black suit. To avoid the suit blending with the black backing, he adds two edge lights. He sets his main light to a lower output so that it retains the drama in the face without overpowering the edge lights.

Fashion photographer Benedikt Ernst and portrait photographer Firat Bagdu have partnered with optical engineer Wolfdieter Prenzel in this reinvention project.

In 1910, Emil Busch introduced the Glaukar, a fully corrected photographic lens, which besides solving spherical aberration, corrected coma and astigmatism was a “usable” lens. Unlike Rudolph’s Protar, which did not work properly at the time of invention because its construction required glass coatings not available at the time, the Emil Busch Glaukar lens was the first anastigmatic lens for daily portrait photography. By creating his anastigmatic lenses, Busch corrected the above mentioned faults by careful combination of the lens elements. Sharpness and artistic images were possible for the first time.

The modernised Glaukar attempts to retain the physical appearance of the original, but will be constructed from high-end aluminum with a brass-like finish.

The lens will feature a maximum aperture of f/3.1, 12 aperture blades, a focal length of 97mm, and will utilize Schott and O’Hara glass.

Ersnt and Bagdu say they were inspired to start this project by Meyer Optik Gorlitz, a company that has been redesigning vintage lenses for some years. The pair says that Meyer Optik helped connect them to Prenzel, who has worked on many Meyer Optik lenses.

Here are some sample images shot with a working prototype:

The new Glaukar lens will come in Nikon, Canon, Sony (E), Fuji, Micro Four Thirds, and Leica (M and T) mounts. It’s expected to ship in May 2018 and is now available to early backers who pledge at least $750 on the Kickstarter page (assuming the project delivers).

After shooting widely published photos showing the realities of animal shelter euthanasia, she began working on a new project called “Landfill Dogs.”



Each week, Johnstone take one of the most overlooked dogs at the Wake County Animal Center in Raleigh, North Carolina, and does a photo shoot with them at Landfill Park, a former landfill that has since been turned into a public park.

“The location is used because the dogs will end up in a landfill if they do not find a home,” Johnstone tells PetaPixel. “These photographs are their last chance. They will be euthanized and their bodies will be buried deep in the landfill among our trash. Below the surface at Landfill Park there are more than 25,000 dogs buried. I think of this park as a burial ground.”

So far, the project has been a success: the Facebook page now has over 37,000 followers, and 156 of the 180 dogs photographed were adopted or sent to a rescue (20 were euthanized and 4 are still waiting for homes).

A photo book of the project titled Landfill Dogs was published in late 2015. You can find more photos and follow along with the project on the Facebook page.

Photographer Zack Berlat was recently lucky enough to end up face to face with basketball legend John Stockton.



In the 4.5-minute video above, Berlat tells the story of how he managed to shoot a portrait of one of his heroes.

During the West Coast Conference Hall of Honor event on March 4th 2017, in Las Vegas, Berlat was shooting for Gonzaga University. He’d heard John Stockton was going to be there, and was unsurprisingly keen to capture a portrait of the university’s legendary alumni.

With some pretty nifty intuition and planning, Berlat knew that Stockton’s time would be very limited (should he even get the chance to speak to him, let alone photograph him). So by setting up a pop-up studio in the hotel hallway, Berlat was sure that he’d be totally ready to snap a few frames should the opportunity arise.

By keeping the flash close to the subject, Berlat left the background in darkness to avoid capturing the ugly hotel surroundings on camera.

After hovering around for 25 minutes, he nervously approached Stockton and asked for the chance to take his picture. Luckily for Berlat, the basketball icon agreed.

There are a number of things that contribute to a great photo. Sometimes nailing just one of these things can carry a photo to greatness. Most photographers would agree that for a great photo you need:

Engagement with the subject

Thoughtful composition

Appropriate lighting choices

Thoughtful editing

One of the biggest things I’ve learned in the last year is how much of an impact the editing process has, so I’ve written this post to share some of the before and afters of my work in the hope it can point other aspiring photographers in the right direction. This will be more of a visual demonstration rather than detailed instructions on how to use editing tools.

You may notice I didn’t mention equipment. You certainly need the right equipment for the job, and for specific purposes only certain specialized equipment will do. But remember these days you can still take a great photo with just about any modern camera, including the phone in your pocket.

My Workflow

Everyone has their own workflow that suits them best. Don’t let anyone tell you how you should work. But, if you’re curious, this is how I have found I spend my time most effectively. I’m going to keep it really simple…

I use Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop because they’re affordable to me. I also have a Wacom editing tablet for accurate touchups in Photoshop, but I very rarely need to use it for my photos.

My Process:

I import all my images into Lightroom.

I cull down to the top images that I want to edit and deliver to the model and other creatives in my team (through iterative flagging/starring of the photos).

I choose an image which represents the average lighting conditions in the set.

I create virtual copies and apply different presets to each copy to compare.

I pick my favourite aesthetic, and apply to the rest of the images.

I tweak each photo where necessary, then crop, spot heal and export at 2048px on the long end to share online.

If I have to, I may open Photoshop to:

Retouch skin around the face if the lighting, resolution or editing has made it distracting AND it’s not what I’d consider a permanent feature.

Content-Aware fill or clone out distracting elements of a photo that I should’ve tried to hide properly in the shoot.

And that’s it. In some cases I can cull, edit and deliver a shoot in 30 minutes. The longest time is generally spent culling!

Before & After Examples

What do my photos look like straight out of the camera? How do I get them from A to B? I won’t be going into the deep detail of every edit because I don’t plan the editing to such great detail on my shoots.

I know generally what I’m going for and choose my lighting carefully. When I’m ready to edit in Lightroom, I use presets I’ve created from previous shoots (which I’m always adding to). Then I modify them until I find something I’m happy with.

I offer some example presets of my own, and I personally got started with some great free presets from Nate Photographic.

The first example is one with huge contrast between the light and dark areas of the image. I chose to capture the light coming through the window on the model’s face and therefore the highlights were the most important part of the image to me. I knew I was going to pull the shadows back up later, so I made sure I got all the detail in the highlights.

It makes it really hard to review the photos with the model along the way, because you can’t see much on the back of the camera. But it’s amazing what you can do with editing. In this example, I pulled back the highlights and whites and pushed the exposure, shadows and blacks. I used the tone curve to bring back contrast and adjust the tones, and made further changes in the HSL, Split Toning and Camera Calibration sections.

Finally, I love to apply a bit of grain which does a great job of hiding distracting details and reducing the likelihood I’ll need to do any retouching in Photoshop.

What about a cloudy day? Sometimes the biggest and most impactful changes are to do with the color palette of the image. Here, I made significant changes to the skin tones and colors of the plants, and desaturated the blue channel to make the dress look white. The shadows were pushed way up and the highlights dropped, and contrast pushed back in with the tone curve.

Now, backlit shots are some of my favorites. And as you can see here, they can be left almost entirely alone! I reduced some of the haze and saturation to get a bit more pop on the model. Most of my backlit photos don’t get edited very heavily, because I prefer to keep the golden haze I get from the sun. Since there’s no hard light hitting the model, it can be very flattering.

Here’s a really impactful one: I had a sunset (without the sun), with some nice foliage catching some remaining light. I had the model stand right in among the bushes but had her face the cloudy sky where the sun was brightest so that she was hit by clean light with no color cast. If there was any significant light bouncing off the bushes, ground or other objects then it would have introduced unwanted colors to her face – you need to watch that, especially on overcast days.

The edit involved a big drop in the highlights and whites and a massive boost to the exposure and shadows. I dropped the blacks a little to keep the contrast in the image. Add a bunch of character with grain and shift the colors, and you can get a very different, pleasing result.

All major edits were still done in Lightroom (slight exposure adjustments, curves and HSL adjustments to get a more desaturated look, and adding grain). I used Photoshop in this case to touch up some of the skin (on-camera flash produces some harsh shadows) and also increase the crop (with content-aware fill and some clone stamping) to balance out the space above the model.

Final Word

Some of these photos I’ve shared stand on their own very well without any editing, but I choose to edit to maintain a preferred visual style. This is what I meant when I said nailing just one of the aspects can carry a photo to greatness. But for the majority of situations, editing plays a part. And it can be really hard as an aspiring photographer to know where to start when you only see the completed image shared online.

I hope this quick rundown has shown you that capturing a great photo is usually more than just what you do on the day, and achieving the results you’re happy with can sometimes involve a lot of trial and error behind the scenes. Don’t give up, and don’t be afraid to ask your fellow photographers about their process. No doubt you’ll develop your own, but I believe when creatives share it can only increase creativity.

Don’t forget: all this applies to many other types of photography too!

This might seem like a really small detail, but pupils that are too small or large look really, really weird.

According to a number of studies highlighted in the 1-minute video above by Koldunov Brothers, people find images where a person’s pupils are more narrow to be less attractive than those with larger pupils.

Shooting in total darkness does the complete opposite to bright light, however, and is too far down the other end of the scale.

It may sound obvious to say pupil size is affected by light, but when was the last time you considered this on a shoot? It also gives potential for specific shoots where you might want weirdly sized pupils…

(via Koldunov Brothers via ISO2000)It goes without saying that lighting is an incredible important aspect to any genre of photography. But in portraiture, light can be used to create, or enhance, emotion in a photo.



In this 13-minute video by The Slanted Lens, photographer Jay P. Morgan gives some great insight into how this works. By applying different lighting styles and colors, he asks the model to display 3 emotions: sad, happy, and evil.

Take, for example, the happy emotion she shows. When this is done under a strongly contrasting side-light, things don’t quite look “correct.” But as soon as she adopts a sad emotion, the lighting pops with the emotion and the photo becomes rather dramatic.

By positioning the light beneath her, an unnatural ‘dark’ light occurs. It’s signatory with evil laughs or horror stories told around campfires, but it’s really interesting to see how anything but an evil look seems very strange.

The tutorial is definitely worth watching. Light is one of the most powerful tools in your photographic arsenal, and knowing how to use to it great effective is of paramount importance.
